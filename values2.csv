"I changed my review to tell everyone, absolutely do not spend money on this game!! Once you get to a certain level ,it's almost impossible to beat and most upgrades are unreachable unless you spend money, and that doesn't help. I'd give it a zero star rating if I could. I'm going to wait to delete it to get some of my money worth. Has potential if it wasn't set up to pay to simply move on to the next level. Disappointed all the way around.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Each level you fight off zombies & acquire ""random"" upgrades throughout. The game withholds gun upgrades so you lose a lot. It's not random and offers everything BUT what you need to win. Played 15 matches, lost them all, no gun upgrades at all. So you burn energy and lose until you can't play or spend $$$. The game is SO SLOW and forces you to replay the same boring levels way too much. Upgrades take ages to aquire. UI is slow, cluttered, looks like garbage, not intuitive, and overall just bad.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Not worth time or money. I do NOT support this game. Down voted and deleted. Tired of extreme power increase per stages and lack of power progression to play. Skill selection is too random, under powered and useless. Half the time the hired mercs are shooting at nothing or shooting behind them. Reported bug with skills aiming lower left of target 90% when at the gate and nothing is fixed or acknowledge. Recommend looking for a better mob game available elsewhere.",Negative,Negative,Negative
Been playing for about 2 months. Fun game but upgrading doesn't seem to make any difference. New levels are much harder than the previous so upgrading your gear and skills make very little difference. Game playability could be better if they made some clear-cut improvements. Players need to feel like they are progressing or they may feel its just a long grind for no reason.,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
Graphically this game is excellent. I really want to like this game but the balance is so poor 👎. It's not fun when the success of each level is mostly based on luck that you'll be able to get the option that will enable you to win. This is the second time I've given this game a chance and it's more true now than the first time I played it. I've since deleted it. Play another game that doesn't waste your time.,Negative,Positive,Negative
"Pretty good game, cool graphics, and challenging levels. My only issue is that when I choose to invite for a global challenge, I keep getting disconnected. The server may need an upgrade on the games end. Other than that, I have been a little bit of a pay to play gamer, so I hope they fix this issue soon. I'm from North America. Also, the customer service is really good at addressing issues you might have, and they are kind.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"Typical money hungry game. Difficulty level spikes up so fast you can't progress without throwing money at it and those ""first purchase"" options are ridiculous. 40$ for a character skin that barely increases your chance of winning. GTFO with your BS devs. Sad part is the game is cool, but just gets to an unplayable point without throwing away money on diamonds to have a CHANCE of winning decent gear, which btw is .005% as shown right on they're loot box drop rates. Worst kind of greedy",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"I've been playing for a while and finally had to uninstall. There are so many skills and items that you can NOT get that are very beneficial without spending real money. You can't even grind to get them, they're simply unavailable without spending. Leveling up what you can get is so unbalanced. It costs so many resources. They do that so you spend in micro transactions. I've seen unbalanced games before, but this is truly insane. It's too bad, it could be a great game. Greed ruined it again...",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"Was fun for a while, until they merged servers. Went from being consistently in the top ten to being in the top 400... I get it. I do. Merging servers reduces costs, and low costs means more money reinvested into improvements. This is not an improvement. This is just discouraging. This does not make me more likely to buy mtxs. It just makes me want to quit. Oh. Wait... I do. L",Negative,Positive,Negative
"A game the looks alright but is an extreme grind even in comparison to other pay 2 win games. Events are broken, powerups are the pretty much the same, and ""multiplayer"" coop mode is full of cancelations or lack of players. I tried this game for several weeks (I got up to level 61) and all unlockable features were all the same. Not worth any in game purchases.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"I like the general gameplay, and updates are decent so far. To ""casually"" enjoy the game, you're stuck spending $10 a month to avoid ads, have unlimited auto-runs, and avoid wasted stamina. They haven't yet addressed declining players (common to all games), but if they can make that happen, the game has a chance. As it is now, my guild has like 2 people active, and inactive friends need to be pruned constantly, and this is only after a month or so of playing..",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
"I want to rate this 4.5. It's good. Solid concept and design. I enjoy it. But the dang thing is buggy as heck. I'm swamped with error messages some days(not always). And always have issues with the ads. A lot of its features are only accessible via watching an ad, which I don't mind... But when it fails to run, you are left with nothing. If it does run, and you click on something accidentally and it opens Google play, you get nothing. It is held back by its bug riddled design centered around ads",Positive,Positive,Positive
"this game is mildly entertaining. I really don't like how some ""upgrades "" actually hurt your damage rating..... it is a pain to keep up with the overwhelming amount of zombies as it is. there is way too large of a variety of upgrades for each weapon as well. then there's the xp. If we are going to have such a huge variety of upgrades maybe allow us to gather more levels in a match. it takes way too long to gain levels when that is your only contribution to gameplay.",Neutral,Positive,Neutral
"Way too dependent on what random upgrades decide to show up. You get a bad run of stuff or the ""incorrect"" stuff for the enemies, you lose. No real strategy or even gameplay to speak of, but if you like watching other people play games, this might be for you, because it's literally watching the app play the game and choosing upgrades for it. The best part was uninstalling it",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Lot of potential. But extremely grindy and poorly balanced. 1-The wheelchair mob's heal spam is ridiculous. 2-You end up repeating the same lvl constantly, until you collect enough resources for marginal power increases. 3-Also, maybe it's just me, but it feels like the game is programmed to make you lose and waste energy half the time. It'll give you useless power-ups and send bullets off in the least optimal trajectory possible. 4-chat lag makes team-ups very frustrating. The game needs work.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"It keeps saying that the platform crashes and that I need to log in but doesn't give me an option to. I uninstall and reinstall and all my information is gone (if the game starts again). I've lost hundreds of hours, money, and I'm beginning to not want to play the game. It's a great game, aesthetics are good, and game play with others makes it fun. But with so many bugs, crashes, and loss of time and money, it's discouraging me to keep playing. That's the problem, I can't get in the game",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
"It sucks that I will miss out on the first 7 day reward, because I just started... but I'm already addicted to this game! UPDATE I missed the 7 day challenge final reward by 10 points (I had 640), because they don't say anywhere in the game how to reset a gear and I couldn't find it. This game needs a tutorial at least. I'm dropping my rating down to 2 stars! I'll give it 1 more week and if things don't improve, I'm just gonna uninstall it!",Negative,Negative,Negative
"it is a good game. no ads unless you want rewards, which is great. my only complaint is that the power upgrades are random, and the more you progress, the less chance you can have any type of build. if there was a way to focus your power ups or even take certain power ups away that you don't use. that would make this game 5 stars for sure.",Neutral,Neutral,Positive
"This game will nickel and dime you if you want to make any progress. You get hard stuck on levels due to the randomness of skills that pop up, most are very weak. Most of the battle passes are tied to using stamina, which you're allotted a max of 30 unless you buy a monthly pass that ups the max. What's also frustrating is that the game will randomly disconnect. Avoid this game if you can. It's a literal waste of time and money.",Negative,Negative,Negative
there's a lot that can be done to improve this game. it's fun as is but can definitely be better. unfortunately the more skills you unlock the less likely the skills you want pop up at level up. improved gun skills should apply to your mercenaries as well. at the end of the round it would be nice to see how much damage your mercenaries did. only 1 reroll on skills per stage is also not great. I could go on but am limited by character count.,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
game started off very fun and soon turned into a very frustrating experience. Anytime I have tried to make a build for certain abilities the game just starts not letting me pick those abilities making clearing stages next to impossible. it doesn't feel random at all basically whatever I try to use gets shuffled to the very end of a stage if at all.,Negative,Negative,Negative
"On 2nd chance, it was fun til a point where no advancement can be made without becoming one of the overly invested types. If no more chests can be unlocked with free play, then the inevitable uninstalling will happen. I've upgraded, embedded, upgraded the upgrades, blah blah blah, and the same results. It's insanity to keep playing, so I'm done. Uninstalling, again, permanently like.",Negative,Positive,Negative
"The game is a very fast gotcha game. this took me 6 tries to get the first level done perfectly. skill evolution should be done automatically. have an idle mode allow the starting skill to be picked. adding changes would make it better. After giving it a 2nd chance , their response is awful. We gave you an item that requires 16 more levels to use . Then tell you that your gear, gems or skills need to increase. At a point where the response was throw money at the problem. Don't download @all",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
"This game has to have the slowest shooting and reloading gun in history. Enemies can take anywhere from 2 to 6 shots to kill no matter what the damage says. Laser always hits the least amount of enemies possible. Not to mention i cleared a stage on almost perfect, leveled up and replayed and took way more damage. Even purchased the offered gun which looks cool but doesn't make any noticable difference play-wise. Avoid. Juice isnt worth the squeeze.",Negative,Positive,Negative
"Has potential, but the game itself is just slow. Slow progression, slow game play, not much to do. No explanation as of power compared to the level you're about to enter, so you have to find out but trial and error, which results in losing energy. Un-installed, I'll try back in 6 months to a year, and it will probably be better.",Negative,Negative,Negative
Game balance is terrible. Half the skills are useless. Game variety relies on randomness of which skill selections are available. If you get too many useless skills you know you're going to lose and it's just faster to restart. either allow more focused skill paths/selections or strengthen the weak skills no one plays with unless they are forced to because of bad luck. Game quickly becomes boring....,Negative,Negative,Negative
"This game is a bait and switch just like every other game. There is no side-to-side game play in which you try to pick the correct number to strengthen or weaken your character. Your character stands in one place, and you periodically choose additional skills, but it's nothing like the ads. No big surprise. It's less about game play and more about spending money and world building. Do not waste your time.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"I love the grind,but in my opinion,you need to double or even triple the gold earnings per attempt for sure. The grind gets to be too much after a while,and the game gets to be boring.You need more descriptions of the weakness of enemies. Some levels seems like it never gives you the skills you actually need to beat the levels. Need to boost stamina to 60 or more.How about more $1 options in the store?I be willing to give this game 5 stars if these things are changed. Other than that fun game.",Neutral,Positive,Neutral
enjoyable slow build up game with lots of little things to keep busy. downside is the math they have after the elite kill and the random pick between one and 4 skills to upgrade is really the problem with the game. it could be one both elite kills and sometimes you get 2 or 4. but they need to change it to 2 of your personal choice. I noticed the math is skewed in their favor. as if you don't level your gun it always put one gun skill in and picks that one skill. I have photos to prove it.,Positive,Negative,Positive
game seems poorly balanced. can complete a level perfect all the way to failing miserably because of random skill upgrades. primary damage source is gun and I have gone up to 2/3 of the way through a level and not gotten a single gun skill. would be better if you could strategize by setting up skills in combos and progression levels. graphics are decent but overall not a lot of fun to play and seems very grinding,Negative,Neutral,Negative
Pretty fun so far. But winning is dependent on what they give you and it's bad. I beat a level 3 times easy right away and haven't been able to beat it again since. I've gotten a lot more powerful since I beat it last. It's easy to mess up you're setup and you have to buy I've thoroughly went through everything. It's a joke,Positive,Positive,Neutral
"As much as I want to rate this higher, I can't. After Stage 7 especially, I feel like the developers are pushing more towards the P2W strats. EDIT: Game may disconnect from servers and force log you from your account. Ensure you account is still linked, or it will wipe all of your saved progress and items you've paid for and reset you back at level 1 with nothing!!",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"It is not fun to play simply because you have to grind the same level over and over just to achieve enough gear, damage to simply move to the next level. The mechanic for killing monsters to get upgrades in current level needs to be accelerated or streamlined to be relevant. Gun upgrades that do not do much at all to the point of asking why is this even an option. Accesory upgrades that are so minimal it lacks impact on the current level.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"There's no way to disable the CONSTANT banner pop-ups at the top of the screen telling you about other players' loot gains. Who cares?? Also, when you launch the app, the game is frozen for a good 30/45 seconds before you can click on anything. Just give a longer load screen or something. it's just dumb",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"This, to me, is a really fun game. The fundamentals are there. I feel like pay to win hasn't hit me yet, but maybe it will. My only big complaint is that leveling up takes waaaaay too long. Experience rates should be almost doubled, or it's just unnecessary grinding. I'm Currently level 25 and there is content locked behind levels that I can't access yet but the game has become repetitive to a grind. So either introduce the new content at a lower level or give more Experience. Thank you!",Neutral,Neutral,Positive
"Far too difficult and takes far too long to unlock a single thing. Not the fun kind of hard either, the kind of hard that makes it tedious and pointless as unlocks are very far between and the rewards you get at every level are very small and not worth while. You don't really gain good power until about 40 levels in and you're designed to constantly fail so getting to level 40 takes forever. Not a good game design.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"Winning in a match is 100% based on the luck of the draw. It doesn't matter what gear you have or skills you choose. If you don't just happen to draw the perfect skills primarily during the first 10 waves, you might as well quit the match and then hope for a better draw the next time.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"Solid 4 star game. Lots of fun, satisfying victories. The only reason I'd say not a five star is some content takes a TON of grinding or paywalling to get to, like timed event completions. But, everything is accessible eventually. Solid game, performs well, interesting multiplayer setup, lots of ways to grow. Well worth the download.",Positive,Positive,Positive
"Update: The game's a cash grab that keeps you reliant on spending by rendering builds pointless. Your core abilities operate in match based on a percentage chance mechanic. They reinforce this by making unlocking core abilities mandatory, since it adds to a crit multiplier. There's no feature to toggle core abilities inactive, making it a strong-arm approach to force players to shoot themselves in the foot. Not to mention difficulty scaling is quick to heavily punish F2p'ers, to incite spending.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"If you like games with a tolerable art style and some cool looking abilities, if you're lucky enough to get them as you constantly feel the RNG is rigged against you to never give you what you need when you need it, with no tech tree display to tell you what your upcoming options, as you hit your paywall extremely quickly, then this game is for you!",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
Playing coop i die and my partner (ie wife) sitting next to me gets perfect clear in same game in elite modes and global rescues it has immense sync issues and makes no sense. Game also forces you to play with people 10% less power then you to recieve torch medals rather then encouraging to play with anyone for rewards. The game needs a list to show you possible upgrade synergies/combos. As well as more build diversity. It is a fun game but could be much better with optimization/features,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
"Played the game for 30 minutes and can no longer access it. The offer pops up and will not go away. Response to SPGAME: I can't reply back to you, so this will have to do. I can not access ANYTHING in game. I see short code for all of the buttons, then they go back to normal. I can't do ANYTHING inside of the game. The 'x' does not work and neither does the button to purchase the pop-up offer.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"The gameplay matches what's advertised, even if it is a bit exaggerated. On top of that I haven't run into any mandatory adds. Those two things by themselves earns at least 3 stars. The gameplay earned the next two stars. The only nitpick I have is that there isn't an ""infinite"" mode where you can see how long a build survives outside of the 20 level cap.",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
"Game is neat and has a lot of potential to be a fun game to kill time, however every time the app closes and I reopen it I am unable to click off any on the pop ups to be able to get to the base game so it's unplayable to me anymore. These include pop ups to try and get me to purchase items and my idle earnings.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Better than similar games. There's just some parts of the game that are confusing with no explanation. For example, there's mentions of ""thunder resistance/damage"", but no thunder weapons. You assume it means lighting, but then there's separate ""electro resist/damage"" and electro weapons. Then the 7 day challenge tasks you with ""reset 1 piece of gear"", but no explanation on the effects it'll have. Not even google/reddit had answers for me.",Neutral,Neutral,Positive
"Great theory, horrible execution. The game devs are greedy and want you to pay heavily to progress. You don't get enough food to play for more than a half hour a day and you can not clear levels consistently unless you pay money. It's like playing craps with zombies. One run you get the perfect cards next run on the same level you get decimated, doesn't make for a fun experience especially when you get limited amounts of tries per day without paying more money.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
"reward system is awful. stage 1 and stage 8 have very similar rewards, not much of a difference. been playing for about a week and stuck on stage 8. lvl 25. very repetitive. doing the same level over and over until I can get enough xp or recorces to continue on to the next stage...",Negative,Negative,Negative
If you are into skill based games this will not be for you its all luck of the draw can't aim or activate skills on your own the computer aims at enemies that are not a threat and getting perfect clears would be more acceptable if you could control even the gunner had situation where i made it to thee end almost perfect but the aim will start shooting down field while zombies attack with no way to redirect aim,Negative,Positive,Negative
"Really enjoying the game, but the timer on Stamina needs to be lowered. I went like 8 hours once without playing, and still wasn't full. Id like to switch servers without restarting, so I can be in a clan with my friends. More things to do with friends would be nice. Other than that, I really like the game. Stop hiding no ads behind a monthly subscription, and get rid of the multiple battle pass, if you purchase monthly card, Battle passes should be free. Remove the pix in google, not in game.",Neutral,Neutral,Positive
The game is so basic you can't do any real aiming it's the same as any other dungeon shooter but you can't run to our move the enemy 😐 the game is a shameful remake of some games with better control. I only played 4 games maybe in if you play now you can get skills or something but what I played was a total disappointment,Neutral,Neutral,Negative
*** can we get rid of the congratulatory announcement banner. It gets in the way.*** Great game no forced ads like other greedy devs out there. The rewards are ok. I think the armor needs to have merge capabilities as well. I now have a bunch of armor that I can only decompose (deconstruct) but better if we had both merge and deconstruct with gems as well. overall gameplay is great. Sometimes RNG is brutal. Awesome job fellas.,Positive,Positive,Positive
"As I'm a person who started playing for free it is imo pretty addicting to see your guns/skills kill zombies and the little events and missions to do are fun. It's by no means a game for adventures it's a idle game with abilities for you to unlock. Most of the stuff is completely free, you could get absolutely lucky for chest drops from the diamonds you earn in mission for perfect clear. You could do that until a certain point then you might need to spend a little. Just like every other game",Positive,Positive,Positive
Ever since the update there has been moments where I can't play an ad at all cause none are available no matter how many times I clear my cache. even deleted and downloaded it again. I can play one to three ads before it stops letting me. The game is rather fun but wish you could get more diamonds without paying so you can enjoy the events going on.,Neutral,Positive,Neutral
The skills in this game are so bad at targeting. The tornado doesn't hit large groups at all. The beam goes after the enemy on the very edge almost every time which totally ruins the game.,Negative,Negative,Negative
It's not the worst game but the auto aim for the game is just bad and way to much rng in the game to be fun. I can see my laser go through 1 enemy instead of just shooting straight in which it would hit about 20 it chooses 1 over 20 so many things the game does to make it impossible to win,Negative,Negative,Negative
"Your character is tied to a server. If that server is full, you cannot play with your character, and are forced to make a new character on a new server and start from scratch if you want to play the game. Servers are near constantly full. One of the worst design choices for a game ever.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Eventually you will get stucked at certain stage and you will need to dump in $$$ to clear the stuckage. Events will rip you at maximum $$$ for minimum rewards. Every server, players quit the game at an alarming pace then they will merge the servers very quickly leaving only the top reloaders pitting against one another for meaningless pvp events. Not recommended.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"very bad, can't log in to the account i had, contacted customer support, was told to try different networks, and ofc it didn't change anything I was told to buy vpn to try from a different country, laughable and unacceptable that the customer support is that bad.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"The game is addictive, until you hit the wall in lvl 12 or so. In order to progress you will have to spend $, and the in-game purchases are overpriced. Gets boring if you don't want to expend $, cause you have to replay older levels in order to get a little bit of progress. It's a pay to progress game. Edit: Had to lower the stars, it's frustrating that you upgrade just to notice that it does nothing. You get stuck on a lvl and take a long time to be able to progress, just to get stuck again.",Negative,Negative,Neutral
The game is good but becomes too grindy way too fast. Even money which you need for a lot of stuff is hard to obtain. Another problem is stages don't offer much rewards for the difficulty they have and some are unnecessary difficult (rigged I'd say to lose) you could perfect clear the previous and next stage is so hard that you can't clear at all. Another minor issue is for a lot of stuff you have to find another player to help and you can't actually search for guild unless you have an invite .,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral
"Took me a month to save up 3K diamonds and ended up spending everything on an event all to get a useless claw fort that picks up mobs and just randomly put them back on field. Alot of char, guns and merc are locked be paying. Way too grindy and pay to win. Stuck on stage 30 for 1 week now and couldn't progress. In order to pass the stage, each skill up must has be a perfect roll and also in the correct sequence. To much variables for one single stage. I will not be back until they fix the game",Negative,Neutral,Negative

"Don't spend any money in this game. Especially you reach stage 60! U can get the good combo, when u get fire extra u won't get explore or others combo. You must spend money otherwise you cant pass the stage. Cheat! They already set inside the system! I am going to uninstall this game",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
"At first it's a funny & addictive game but nearly at lvl 18 & higher it's a pay to win game. Bonuses, passives, gears are too rare to get so the game designed to motivate its users to pay money for proper achievements which is unfair. Personally I stopped playing that much that I used to. The upgrades for gears especially the gun isn't reasonable & senseless. If it goes this way I'm sure many players will abandon the game & that would be a great shame.",Negative,Positive,Negative
"This game is pure pay to win. Everything you need to advance is out of reach. Events aren't long enough to get anything useful. Also, many events require real currency. Gold shovel event forces you to spend diamonds or real dollars. Gun upgrades, Skin upgrades, drone upgrades, etc... requires you to spend. Otherwise you just are grinding for weeks just to pass the next stage.",Negative,Positive,Negative
"The game is pretty solid for the most part, but you all need to do way better in regards to being more giving to your f2p base, they really have nothing to work towards and everything is focused on those who have money to freely spend. There needs to be events for f2p as well so they can have something to work towards, new outfits, guns, things of that nature. Also, please grant us a version that is completely offline, with laxed methods on getting resources, thank you for reading!",Positive,Positive,Neutral
"was a decent game until i came across a game breaking bug. was playing ruined park on expert, game gave me a skill past lvl 20 but no pictures or options. everytime i try to load back in, it doesnt the same thing. i dont think its fair for me to restart the whole mission because of it.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"Game is fun early on until it become PAY to progress later on. Event is all gem sinker u literally have to pray to the gacha god. Dev don't intend to make this game fun for the player. If u get no core or skin, u can kiss ur account goodbye. Grinding is omega tedious and lvl up reward is abysmal. There is no incentive for progression. U can't farm gem as it limited to progression. 1 day u only get like 50 gem from daily mission. For ppl who is looking for a fun game, stay away from this game.",Negative,Neutral,Negative

"Pretty rough money grab. A copy of a copy with retextures. Edit: I will amend my comment but not rating. After several months and hundreds of dollars I've determined the creators didn't expect this game to do so well. So, updates from this company that doesn't care about the longevity or quality of this game are coming, but only as long as it's profitable. In my mind, the money spent here was worth it just to see for myself how this kind of operation is successful. It's all such a waste though.",Negative,Neutral,Negative

"Once you get to level 30 your gum won't do any damage and also they don't reward you with a way to upgrade your gun, they have events and if you don't spend at least 100$ or more you won't get a single upgrade. It's a fun game until around lvl 30.",Neutral,Neutral,Neutral

Beware people if you wanna have fun casual game THIS IS NOT IT. they want to much money. Stuck on levels for weeks on end. Pay for monthly cards that give you 100 quick raids per day but still get no better. Cmon people I have given you plenty of money on two months of playing. Do better. Unclutter this mess and make fun and playable. Uninstalling until these money grabbers make it less cluttered and more fun.,Negative,Neutral,Negative
Gambling on trying to pick an upgrade is so stupid and very lazy for the creators I don't know why they even put that option if you're going to do it make sure you can choose a right one a better one and if it's paid to win then you don't deserve to make games then just saying anyone who reads this I suggest you find a different game because if you're going to play it be ready for the most boring laziest thing ever no excitement just one ways it's not like the game developers tried,Negative,Neutral,Negative

Definitely reccommend playing a different game. 0 Stars.",Negative,Negative,Negative
This used to be fun but has turned into little more than a money grabbing whale hunt of a game. Many players have left and the servers merged down into remaining mega whales.

Utterly disappointing after the updates and when the same gems setting in game gets so much weaker. Wished I have never started the game and never pay to play in this.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Connection very buggy, grind gets monumental too fast, p2w game, can do f2p but must be a masochist, its not bad just it becomes a timesink fast looses all the fun as without spending its really just a frustrating gring with no fun, as all nice thing are heavily paywalled if it was cheaper fine expect to see ads forever as there is mo permanent way to take off as add ticket only lasts a month",Negative,Positive,Negative
"Don't download. Ads everywhere. The games ads look very fast but in reality it slow and time consuming for small reward. Not worth no spend time for this. Again, don't download or support game like this.",Negative,Negative,Negative
Awful!!! No skill involved!!! It's just a random lottery that is designed to keep failing you so you keep playing pointlessly!!! You upgraded items/Skills may never even show up or if you lucky maybe just the ones out of 20!!! Awful game,Negative,Negative,Negative
After spending money for a spin and not getting the prize it landed on was total BS smh took a screenshot of it too before it was removed. Can someone help?,Negative,Neutral,Negative
"The worst about this game: - U can't send everyone energy and get therefore barely send any - Pay to win is next level. Unreasonable prices - The speed of waves is horrible - Time spend = progress gained = slow, painful , unrewarding - Guilds are unrewarding - needs serious luck sometimes to progress, rng is meh Needs some serious balancing. Needs events that make u return because u gain progress. Definetly needs a better friendship system, better guild system. played for a few weeks",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Exactly what I wanted! Yes, it's a bit grindy and pay to win is an option but honestly the depth of gameplay, upgrade options and game design are fantastic. Brilliant",Positive,Positive,Positive
If you get a plus 1 to your skills the other one goes to space make the skills got to the front where you need them to that's my only complaint.... Why does it feel like I got way weaker can't do the things I used to at all I know I'm not the only one.... I meant to rate four stars,Positive,Negative,Positive
"This game suffers from a serious problem, like all other similar games. When you level up, you can pick one of three random upgrades. But as you unlock new weapons, the upgrade pool is severely diluted, and the chance of getting the upgrades you want is greatly reduced. There are too many trashy skills and upgrades in this game, and eventually the game becomes an exercise in frustration as you rely on RNG to get the upgrades you want and repeat the same old levels over and over again.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"Game is very useful to spend time it's a simple one player game and the game has awesome graphics, characters. Y'ALL NEED GET THIS GAME AND PLAY IT FOR WHILE HAS LOTS OF OPTIONS. Add more fire power other types of weapons keep updating the game guy.",Positive,Neutral,Positive
"This game real money currency is broken. They have to fix Usd>Try currency. 14.99 US dolar pack shows up 737.49 Turkish lira instead of 511.01 Turkish lira. Other packs are have this extreme numbers. 1 USD is not 49.19 TRY. Dear devs you can not earn money from Turkish players with this extreme currency charge. On other games everything is normal but on this game, the numbers are totally rip off attempt.",Negative,Negative,Negative
terrible. they advertise a promo code but it doesn't exist. completely pay to win. avoid this game.,Negative,Negative,Negative
"UPDATE: The grind is REAL!!! Unless you are willing to buy ridiculously expensive bundles you will need the patience of whatever saint your chosen religion prays to. It is VERY slow to level up your character, skills and gear without buying bundles with gems. In game rewards of gems are definitely not balanced compared to the cost of shop items. Everything is designed to almost force you to pay to win. That being said, If you can hold out paying it's a fun time waster of a game.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
I tried to change the server before putting the new character but it won't let me so I'm extremely disappointed,Negative,Negative,Negative
I still would like to view the elites and bosses that will appear in each stage please. Why didn't the monsters I encountered in abyss mode unlock in the research? And shouldn't the boss I also met be stopped from damaging my base? Is it a bug or something? And shouldn't it say results after completing each trial? When will you respond?,Positive,Negative,Neutral
"Unbalanced game with really frustrating RNG that works against the player. On stages where enemies are weak to fire it is quite common to not give you any fire skills until turn 10 which is half-time. And you only get one chance to reroll the skills given, but you might get the same unwanted skills. Starting from stage 20 the enemies become bullet sponges and come in hordes, that only a few skills are effective.",Negative,Negative,Negative
"Rating 3 just for addiction, otherwise 2, simply for the fact the developers are either sadistic and enjoy players struggling to cross scene/lvl or the brains behind are, and you HAVE to pay to progress. Un-installed post being stuck in scene 45 for 2 weeks despite reaching lvl 66. FTP, but give us a break sometimes. If you are not willing to shell out $, please dont waste time here. The in-game upgrades are as pathetic as it can get, what you need to cross the scene always comes too late",Negative,Negative,Neutral
"Based on what they're currently advertising, a lot of it you cannot do. Aesthetics customization is extremely rare. That includes your weapon and your character. There's no free skins or premium skins. It doesn't really make sense to advertise customization if you don't have these options. You can only upgrade items and skills. The language is inconsistent in some parts. Hopefully, they hire someone to look through that. It's frustrating. My experience is dull. I wouldn't recommend it right now.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
"I can't email their ingame customer support, it keeps saying ""enter a correct email address"" BUT I AM, tried two different ones even. I'm trying to add my friend but it just says ""character not found"" when I search his name, and surely it can't be because he's on another server right, because the list shows people from different servers. Either way you'd have to start the game from scratch if you wanted to swap servers! Fix your ingame customer support.",Neutral,Neutral,Negative
"Torn on this one. It's fun and engaging, but beyond a certain point the upgrades slow down so it becomes a slog, even with all the variation within the game. Lots of different play modes/upgradeables can't mask when trying to advance in the main gameplay grinds to a near halt. I'll still keep playing, but can feel my interest waning with each repeat of a level. You can level up quicker, but that involves spending money, which... Meh. Spending money to advance is, to me, a sign of bad dev.",Negative,Neutral,Negative
"Decent game but horribly unbalanced once level 5 or so. Bullet upgrades and APC are the only ones worth getting. Without them, your just overwhelmed, firing at a snails pace and 10 or so shots to kill the most basic enemy, with 60 plus enemies on the field. EDIT - I just told you the issue. You report it. It's your game. Auto responses are worse than no response. Minus one.",Neutral,Negative,Neutral
"Terrible controls. The game spes through the tutorial level, which was nice, but was definitely unintended as it was happening during an 'update'. The game is also a definite clone of Doodle Wizard from the abilities to the damage and skull progression - as for security well, let's just say you should avoid giving the game anything more than a burner email. I accidentally used my normal one and I'm suddenly getting targeted by emails about deliveries that I'm missing.",,,
"I do like the potential i am seeing im this game, but a handful of things worries me for the long run. One being the painfully obvious rigging of the runs contra ""perfect clears"" objectives, i know it's supposed to be randomized, but this is Candy Crush-style ""you will fail this run, period"" rigging from time to time. My othee concern is overall meta progression between levels, it feels very limited and wirhout any real impact. i'll keep playing, but we'll see if it remains.",,,
"been playing for 2 days - interesting at first and turn boring real fast. Progress until level 10 or so and unless you keep grinding again and again don't hope to progress any further. most skills are completely useless and not balanced at all. The only skill that matters are the gun related ones, yet the more skills you've unlocked, the less chance that the gun skill will pop up. so to clear a stage, you will have to be extremely lucky. No skill involved. will not keep playing personally.",,,
"Merging gems gives too much junk, purple gems not merging. Random choice weapons in battles rarely give gun upgrades till you are so strong you can complete the stage with no gun upgrades, then it gives them 10 times more, that is no good to us. Try programming bullet upgrades to come more frequently. It not fun knowing I can beat the stage with enough bullet upgrades but I don't get enough of them, 1 in 20 times I win a battle. If I have no food I must wait for reset to play, not fun.",,,
"Not too shabby, my biggest issues are, 1. gear enhancement is a little weak, more gear drops, different variations and types of gear and perhaps an option to sell or trade in. 2. levelling up could be improved. better reeards for reaching different milestones. 3. have gear drops out of the chests as well as gems, giving you a chane to gain a different weapon ot piece of equipment. over all, aside from these points, it's a lil bit of harmless fun to kill some time.",,,
"Ok, first this game has +damage% system which will deflect you from getting the right upgrades that you need. Could have merge it with the upgrades. Another thing this game's reward system is one of the worst, if not the worst of all the games I have played. You won't get anything AT ALL. Basically nothing is free. I'm a strictly f2p player and I'm rank 24 in my server. If you think that you could get those things behind the paywall for free. Don't get your hopes up because you won't.",,,
"Fun at first but way too grindy at around level 25. The only good upgrades are for your main weapon; everything else is filler. If you don't get those +damage, multi-hit and penetratio might as well restart the run",,,
"Couldn't get back my account, wanted to logout of the new game then ""SWITCH"" but keep giving error saying can't switch many time which is my first switch. Worst is the game auto ""START"" even though there is a start button for you to manually start, so you won't be able to go to the ""USER"" button at main page with the start button. So now my game should have over written since i bind in the game main page (with all the game icons), usually if you do bind ingame it will auto detect but no.",,,
Game play is terrible. Gets to a stage where the mobs are way too strong and the skills needed to pass the stage never appears. Only way to win is if u pay to buy better equipment. And the price keeps increasing with each event. Drops in draw are horrendous too. Need at least 2 x $99 packs worth of diamonds to get anything good in events,,,
"Designed to give you random upgrades that you don't want so the only way to progress levels is to either be exceptionally lucky or to pay for upgrades that you probably can't access during missions anyway. Total waste of time. You will know if you have ANY chance of passing a lvl within the first 3 waves, but can still be screwed over by 2 unwanted upgrades at any moment",,,
"It starts easy but along the way gets exponentially harder, forcing you to buy in-game items. Also, some powers behave strangely and you don't have a saying on how the attacks occur, so you cannot switch targets or attack efficiently. In a way, this is just another idle game with a huge griding level with very minimal interaction from the user",,,
New review. The updates have been great and the community is really helping the devs out in how to improve the game. I still believe it's still heavy P2W. Maybe pay walls in levels and other events. Few improvements needed.,,,
There are 2 huge issues with the game. Honestly would be a 5 star game if you fixed these. The first being reloading. It shouldn't be a thing. A 4 second animation in this kind of game is not a good mechanic. Also the 3 options should always have a gun upgrade option. Add these and it's a 5 star game easy,,,
"Good job, that last update killed the game won't start game anymore. Just white screen of deaths. Multiple try and 10min the screen won't load. Dead game now? Fix the last fix please.",,,
"the game is cool but it's a pay to win, the rewards gotten from daily missions needs to be increased, and the rewards from dungeons needs to be something useful and rewarding not the trash loot that makes you need to farm for a month to pass the next level perfect completion. here is the solution for all these reset the perfect completion rewards for all the dungeons once a month because this is the only worthy rewards we get.",,,
"Brilliant game. graphics, and game play are amazing and fun to play up to around level 15, which is then ruined by abominable player, gun and skill progression, bored and frustrated with monotonous level replay. I've spent a little money to improve my odds, but still stuck in same rut!!",,,
"Its full of bugs. Don't release a game if you haven't fixed the basic bugs yet. That's what Alpha and Beta are for. I can't even enter the game because the banner to buy the gun for 0.99 or 1.99 whatever it was, doesn't go away and I can't click anywhere. I restarted 5 times and it always gets stuck on the same place. Its really a pity because the concept of the game is not bad.",,,
"This is one of the games that I truly felt frustrated to play. You win not by good choice of skills, synergy or playstyle. You win by luck. Yes, purely by luck. And this luck is determined by the first few abilities that are randomly given, and only some abilities win the game, the rest are useless. So it's a 1 star for me, nothing is as frustrating as a pointless grind.",,,
"it's okay but to perfectly clear a stage there's a lot of luck involved, been playing for a few hours it's not bad, a lot of the upgrades miss or target small group of monsters instead of the horde, for example the energy beam shoots diagonally and basically wastes itself after killing 3-4 monsters while you have 20 coming straight down the middle",,,
Good game ruined by underhanded and sleazy design choices that cripple the player in order to force purchases.,,, 
"Way too RNG based. You're given 3 options for upgrades chosen at random. Unfortunately the pool gets so insanely large some options you will never see a second time. No changes to my character, same level, went from losing horribly to a perfect victory based on the RNG options provided. Doesn't the RNG screwing you over make you want to give us money? No it makes me want to give you a 1* review and play something with a little player agency.",,,
"The game is engaging and keeps me playing. Tho, it feels that animation is pretty bad. It's annoying that aside from the main character, the rest of the compnions are static, yet the bullets shoot left and right. Felt like it's a bit half-baked. Hope they update this.",,,
If you like survivor games you'll love this! Really well thought out game very f2p friendly. not many ads so you can spend most of your time playing which is great. Lots of upgrade options and lots to unlock as you level up. Please open up cross server coop across all servers and friends lists. Lots of older servers are full of dead players 😉,,,
"The game is quite addictive for its simplicity, which I personally love. Additionally, most times, you would get stuck, which leads to having to put money into the game. I would suggest minimizing/lowering the pay to win aspect of the game, which in my opinion would increase the longevity of the player base. Furthermore, create cross server platforms where all players can play together and not only within the hundred (100-199), for example.",,,
"Game concept not so good.. basically need to grind stages, again and again, and even so unable to clear stages. Rate for boost bad as well, even though seems to be winning, and with one bad boost, lose so its rather disappointing. And the game doesnt give as much freebies for upgrade which is quite sad. Alot of improvement points for better gameplay",,,
"The 3 stars are for the addiction. I haven't let go of this game after installation, and I play several games on my phone and PC. I play this game more than any other I've played in a long time. The problems are: - Takes too long to level up. - In-game skill selection is highly imbalanced. Please fix this. I'm ready to uninstall it after a dozen more attempts at perfect-clearing LVL 17, which I've been trying for a week.",,,
Idk what happened to my level 69 player but I'm not trying to start all over. Y'all need to fix this,,,
I was trying to play but every time it kept on telling me I have to go to another sever Pls fix this,,,
The duration of ad is 45 seconds that's way to much showing 2 ads at a time,,,
"Changed to 1 star, don't play this game it is extremely bad. The more you play the more you realize how much you need to spend to progress after the first week. I've been stuck on 1 stage for the past 7 days and I've only played for 13... 99% of usefull progression is hidden behind paying options or diamonds which you barely get as a f2p. This game is a buggy, unfinished, greedy mess hidding behind the mask of a ""good community"". Its bad",,,
"Fun game but don't waste your time. Instead of the game increasing in difficulty, zombies just become immune to damage making it impossible to progress and you're left with a feeling.... everything I did in this game was for nothing. Spent 10 dollars on it got to lvl 15 was about to spend more money and I realized this cheating game got me. Play something else, you'll thank me.",,,
"This game is extremely buggy. Many events are broken and/or don't pay rewards correctly. Support is useless and gives zero f*****, even when the bugs literally cost you money. Doodle Magic is better than this knockoff.",,,
"This game creator is so stingy,all the mercenary choice given is too less,and for the fortress upgrade,is impossible to get it unless u spend,for the gun choice also very less,monster damage are too high until even can't clear the stage even with 10k hp fortress",,,
Dont bother spending money unless u have tonnes to spare. $20 for 30 purple keys makes barely any diffference. Progress is so slow u barely feel any.,,,
I already play this game before and I like it..but when I try install it back it says the server is full..and it don't give me option to choose server because when I open the game..it immediately go to pick character..please fix this,,,
After updating its login error.....not able to login ... It's reinstall and working but my old I'd lvl gone can't login find my old ID server .have to start from 1st onwards . please help me with get me back my old ID .even mailed and ticket raised ..,,,
"Been trying to log on for the last 2 days, says failed to connect to server s625. Tried to contact customer support but that won't come up either",,,
"great game,just a cash dump,barely get anything useful.constantly stuck on stages and barely any rewards from stages.gacha pull rates are really low. overall great game just money hungry devs",,,
It doesn't upgrade the main weapon during fight. It gives mostly some ice things to attack and becomes boring.,,,
"Cool game, but the RNG in this game is stupid. Progression is too slow, requires tons of hours to progress, unless you pay to progress. Ugly, ugly dev.",,,
I freaking love this game. I've never really gotten into these types of my games but this one just drew me in! Been playing for a while now even got the wife on it! Keep the updates coming and hopefully new attacks soon!,,,
"Ok. But by round 8 you hit a grind wall. Seems to have potential but without spending cash, you progress just slows to nothing.",,,
Good game but today on the mega serpent raid game crashed twice. took my gems and both attempts with no damage. crashed when using vanguard grenades,,,
addictive and fun to play...but the customer service are not very helpful in regards of deleting account...wasted couple of months to do so...in the end give up the game,,,
Basically this is a survivor type clone...in idle mode = next to zero strategy or skill required to play = BORING. The base menus are pretty and clean but the core gameplay experience is boring and unsatisfying as per most idle titles. I don't suggest anyone wastes their time on titles like this unless you want to kill your brain cells and / or wallet. Always astounded by 5 star reviews of such apps... Seriously you guys need to rethink your concept of fun and perfection!,,,
"Poorly balanced game economy and game design. It was fun until it's grindy and needing to spend. Needing too much time to complete dailies or gameplay as well. Most stuff locked behind paywall for perks which was minimal as well. Gameplay progression revolve around specific gemstone for bonus for example instant kill, while those who don't have it might as well just quit/restart the account. Dev respond player suggestion and opinion has been minimal.",,,
"I had to delete four games just to play bang bang survivor. I played this game for ten minutes then I got a finger cramp, really all you do is tap at enemies and your player will shoot them, it's kinda hard because the small enemies have basically the same amount of health the big ones have, and the name to the game is idk it didn't sound very exciting. sorry for my review🗿",,,
"Small minnow spender initially, but I have experienced several instances of being matched with hackers who ruin the game, much to my chagrin. Witnessed: no skill cooldowns; all core and skin skills unlocked on a new player; a telltale sign is that both avatars and mercenaries spawn right in the middle (clipping too).",,,
"Nice defence game. Ads for rewards is reasonable. -1 star for the in-game announcement banner, which is meaningless and annoying.",,,
"Decent game but extremely expensive or time consuming to advance in the long run, meaning its p2w or years of grinding on current stage , if you dont want ads you have to pay monthly , prices are crazy and USD. If you grind constantly you which is super slow process you ll never catch up .Would recommend only of you log whenever you really bored and you are super casual , for people that spend hundreds of $$$ there are better things to spend on , there are mobile games with better monitization",,,
"Designed to make you waste stamina time and money, a character you can't control that focuses on enemies that are miles away from the objective while there are enemies on the objective destroying it, 5 different battle passes all costing 5-30 dollars a piece, this is a mobile game, you don't have the right to extort people the same way EA does, not to mention they bait you with the idea of legendary gear by showing you a ""totally real player"" unboxing one every 5 seconds at the top of the screen",,,
"fun game but some things don't seem to work like renew reagent. But other then that its great, definitley a grind. Update: game is now glitchy and continues to disconnect me very frequently. Multiplayer is almost impossible to play with how much I get disconnected. Changing my original rating until this is fixed",,,
"The game is not fun at all. All you do is tap a button to start a level and sometimes buy upgrades. The passes you can buy don't really help new players. They only give you a little bit of the in-game money, and that's it. They don't give you any of the crystals, which you need to buy the good stuff. And every once in a while, you'll get one of those cheap keys, but they're not really worth anything. They just want you to spend money.",,,
"Looks very similar to the advertisement I saw on tik tok. Runs smoothly, has real multi-player, easy to get into and understand. EDIT: Had to come back to change it to 5 stars! The cafeteria is a HUGE help when it comes to stamina. Please check your cafeteria frequently! Also, add friends to send/receive stamina. (The limit is a little silly imo, but at least it's another option for stamina). Also decompose your old gear to ascend your better stuff! Overall, great game 👍",,,
"Bang. Survivor is a pretty fun game. The feeling of progression really hits in this one. It is possible to play entirely free, and you can get a boost through ads too. I just got access to mercenaries and WOO what a gamechanger. Thank you for this game. I am having a great time.",,,
Binded the account to my Google account then when my phone had problems it lost all the data and even when i tried to use the login via google it was unable to retrieveanything and keeps reseting it to a lvl 1 account. My lvl 68 account just gone like that.,,,
Suddenly I lost all my progress in the game. The game tells me that the server is full and does not give me the opportunity to choose another server.,,,
"SCAM!!!!!!!! Accidentally Change the server number, not knowing it would erase the game plus all the extra money I spent on top of we're erased",,,
"Abysmal. It takes FOREVER to do anything unless you pull out your wallet. And the weapon system is just awful. I have to upgrade my gear, weapons, the abilities the game gives me AT RANDOM, and I have to do this while the probability of actually getting the stuff I need is slim at best? Whaaaat?! Then I might not even get the weapon I based my gear around meaning that I'll be at a massive disadvantage if it doesn't show up and even then I have to get the right boosts for the weapon early. WHY?",,,
Please fix the server reconnecting issue. It disturbs the whole pupose of playing games. I choose a different server the rooms are full. Please resolve this ASAP or i might have to be foreced to delete this game. I was on Level 6 now again after reconnecting the game I am again back to basic level 2 what the hell is wrong my whole progress is a waste. Please solve this issue and put me back to my kevel 6.,,,
"fairly generous with giving out premium currency, premium purchases can be underwhelming. has enough content to warrant a few purchases, but some of them have poor value return. overall, it's a fun game that doesn't reward wallet warriors too much. can be played without spending any money and still be fun.",,,
"legons need vast improvements. legon chat is garbage. The messages in legon chat disappear after players log off. legon store has a very poor selection of items for players to want to work towards. The legion fair gives no description as to how it works and how to actually use it (a tutorial is needed)! Other than these major drawbacks, the game ain't bad easy 4 out of 5 stars.",,,
"This game is basically a pay-to-win game. If you don't pay, there will be no gaming experience at all.",,,
"so far so good. This is a different spin on a defence shooter. while I love the in game mechanics, there is a bit lacking in the control department. I would like to see players be able to control the direction of the gun and give more freedom to letting the player decide where to shoot instead of having it decided for them.",,,
"Honestly not bad for a ""free to play"" mobile game like this. There are absolutely pay to win aspects, but it's at least fairly generous to FTP players. i.e. it has an energy mechanic, but it refills fairly quick and there are plenty of bonus energy available (just don't redeem it until you need it). I've yet to actually be gated by it as a result",,,
"The game is good. I like the abilities you get. What I don't like is the fact that if you try to find your friends and join their server, you have to start over at level 1. Tried putting my friends name in so I could have them as my friend, and the game keeps telling me that that player can't be found.",,,
"Fun little defense game. Gameplay and graphics good. Wish there was a way to guarantee some level up choices more, sucks to fail a level simply because of poor options. Monetization doesn't feel too greedy, and there are some free/free with ad goodies.",,,
"it's an ok game if u r looking to kill some time but some stuff is kinda redundant like the gun upgrade - magazine capacity, it's so insignificant (0.5%) that by lvl26 it hasn't even increased my ammo capacity by 1 Also, the loot box rates they lable isn't accurate, for e.g. the common loot box chance of getting an orange gem was labeled 0.05%, collected 100 keys n draw them all at once. Should have gotten at least 5 legendary gems if the chances were real, end up not getting even 1",,,
"A lot of UI bugs. The last one stopped me from playing the game. ""Do you want to continue the last challenge"" doesn't respond and appears even after force stop the game.",,,
Very slow attack update rate. But for every stage progress enemy hp gets too high to defend,,,
"A decent game, gets monotonous after a while. After playing for 2 weeks, I still don't know what to get/buy where. Hence, I think the options should be a bit more clearer. Also, the general shop has crates which drop only stones. Maybe, it should be a generic box with options to get multiple types of things.",,,
"Love this game, 2 problems: when I load up the game, I have to wait 15-20 seconds for the game to respond to my touch inputs. That isn't too bad, but just now I had my worst issue. A monster got stuck in a corner where no matter what I did, none of my skills would hit while it continued to do damage until I lost. This was in battle arena.",,,
"Fun concept, but the grind is unreal. P2W is hardcore. I started in a new server and 1month of hard grind, got barely to stage24, char lvl51. People that started with me, but bought boosts are 3times or more stronger than me. Overall, there's lack of reward and you start to loose interest, since there's no progress for the effort you put into the game.",,,
"This game will definitely become a daily time sink for you. I also have to make a shout out to the developers. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THIS A VERY ACCESSIBLE FREE TO PLAY GAME! It is ONLY an option to spend money on this game, it is not like you're having daily/weekly/monthly deals being thrown at you while you're playing the game. I spent 1.57 CAD for the 3 day beginner bonus so far and thats it.",,,
"No matter how much you upgrade the gun power it still take way too much time to reload, which is so stupid.",,,
normally I don't enjoy these games I see an ad for but I'm actually finding myself addicted. only issue I really have is the spinning blade duration big. it'll extend the timer but the blade will end before the new timer finishes making it take way longer to get the blade off cool down,,,
"I like the concept, but all progress is ridiculously slow unless you spend money. It's not even balanced. You feel the need to pay within the first couple of areas. Definitely one to avoid if you want to play for free. The grind is insane and boring.",,,
"Would have been 5 stars because once you open up the game, there will be a delay like 5-7 seconds before you can tap anything. I don't think it's my phone because I am using ROG 6 ultimate. My wifi is also super fast. Anyway, game is good, I'm enjoying it.",,,
"They need to change the other power up options, I've been playing for a few days now and I've noticed that assult rifle is the only worth it upgrade option it's quite frankly has better output, CD, and duration compared to the others Armored Vehicle in particular is utter garbage, and although some of the other options have a good output it falls greatly short on duration and CD that it's basically pointless especially compared to the Assult Rifles upgrades",,,
"It's a pretty solid game. no forced ads. auto shooter, and you pick upgrades. nothing limit pushing, but it gives you satisfaction. they have a guild system, I think.... never even looked at it. I play single player style so offline would be cool.",,,
"I love this! Would be 5 Star but I cannot fathom out why you run out of stamina and therefore can't play any longer, even when you've watched all ads and exchanged diamonds etc. But be warned, it will drop to 1 Star if it turns into another legion v legion game like King Of Avalon et al. Currently, it's fun and relaxed, really enjoying!",,,
"great game, optional ads only! There's a bug with the Drone Blade power tho, if you give it the duration increase while it's out then it just disappears randomly. very frustrating, doesn't happen with any other power-up. amazing game though",,,
TRASH!From the beginning it takes several clips just to slay one enemy!Eventually Your going to hit a paywall just like every other gane here.👎,,,
"Fun game, but you have to spend some serious money to compete. Most players don't last. My server is about 2.5 months old, and there's only about 50 active players.",,,
"The game is somewhat decent, but good gods is it pay to win. And the prices are stupid high. I regret wasting my time with it honestly",,,
When you watch the ads to reroll the power ups several times it gives you the same power ups...,,,
Got cheated by the ads. Ads shows different game. Played this game once and delete.,,,
"Sadly after playing for a while this game is so punishingly aimed at monetization. Leveling is horrendously slow, like, absolutely terrible , esp since your new powers unlock progressively through leveling. Was really hoping for this one ,but, I can't recommend this to anyone in good faith. Avoid unless you like leveling ridiculously slow and feeling weak still.",,,
"Very fun and addicting especially when you get a good run. Ads/Microtransactions are pretty uninvasive for the most part which is great. The only improvement I would ask for is make the 1.5x speed available on everything, or change 1.5x to be the default speed for all the levels. 1.5x feels a lot smoother and also makes it easier to play a quick round or two.",,,
"Inconsistent enemy health. You can hit one enemy with a stray bullet and still have to hit it three to four times. Just like normal hitting it. Also, games like this, stamina systems are not that great. Let us play, not wait.",,,
"One of the most boring games I've ever played. You literally control nothing in this game. You can't move, you can't aim, and you can't activate powers. You just watch as your woefully underpowered character shoots slow, weak bullet after slow, weak bullet. This app is an embarrassment.",,,
"This game offers user friendly graphics content, however, I don't like how little number of games I can play per day and there is a reload time of few seconds which makes it more challenging to pass the levels than other games but overall, I think this game is UNIQUE & ADDICTIVE! 😄😁👍👍👍👍",,,
"Not worth the time. Similar experience with all the other reviews. Too dependent on RNG, only the gun upgrades matter which you wouldn't get unless you're very lucky. You can revisit a lower level many rounds later and fail (despite having better equipment) just because of poor RNG. Extremely poor game design.",,,
"Pretty addicting game, but lack of resources obtained each match bummed me out.... Have to grind on one map a few times just to upgrade 1 or 2 things that barely increase the damage of my attacks/skills... Hopefully the devs will add new items/events so it's easier to obtain resources....",,,
"Good game but the scaling of difficulty is very bad, from lvl9 to lvl10 the difficulty changed a lot, not only are enemy so powerful that gun is mostly useless only ability can do something but the lvl also has ranged attackers, so my character is killing close enemies who are not doing anything while other are damaging from far... Even after 2 days of grind and lvling till around lvl 20 i still couldn't do anything... There is a difference between a fun grind and tedious and frustrating grind.",,,
I literally can't interact with anything. I played the first stage and then when I closed the app and reopened it I can't press anything. I even tried reinstalling the app and nothing. Waste of time. The suggestion the developer provided in this reply is worthless as I was unable to even interact with the settings button.,,,
Dont waste ur time. No progression unless you spend real money. Too heavy on pay to win. the event grand prizes are rigged that u have to use over 25000 in game currency (over 300 dollars wort) for the main item that you will never get unless u spend. Money pit. Poor rewards and horrible compensation for errors,,,
"It's an ok game but the requirements for the 7 day challenge thing are ridiculously high. Clearly not something 'normal' people are expected to achieve without spending money, and if that's how it starts then I can't see things getting any better the longer I play!",,,
fun game bot reel slow. culd b butter. the upgrades chances of you tieing to get what you want is super low so you'd have to opt four a different build path which is kinda annaying. you can get purfict 1 round then when you go again you basically lose immediately. I'm only lvl 32 right now and lvl 40 looks like the level you need to reach in order to at least enjoy the game better.,,,
"The heavily p2w game I actually enjoyed. No joke when i say heavily p2w. Also, good luck passing stage 30. The reason u can't pass it for weeks is cause u didn't spend enough. I spend $100 - $150 and stuck at stage 29 for a week now. Cause I didn't spend enough. Hope this review helps.",,,
"Don't need any technical to play this game, more money & time you spend you're more stronger. Skill buff like playing slot machine, if you lucky your buff skill combination is good, if bad luck your buff skill combination is suck. If you spend alot money character stronger, you can pass the level easily. If you don't spend money or spend less, then you need spend alots of times. And chest draw rate super super low, if you want get the loots you must spend alot only have the chance.",,,
"Slow and punishing toward free players. You'll end up stuck on a stage very quickly, trying to brute force your way through with random skill selections against tons of enemies that take several hits to defeat. And there's an energy system, just to make sure you don't luck out.",,,
"Game uses visuals to try and trick you into thinking the drop rates are better than they are. It will use a graphic that makes it seem like you have a 1 in 5 shot to get an item you want, but if you look in the details, it's usually under a 1 percent chance.",,,
"Updating until I get clear feedback. The matchmaking system and player base are terrible. People leave at the beginning of matches. You can't play with clan mates, and there's no reporting system or way to view past matches. It was fun at the beginning but it just feels terrible now.",,,
"The ""skills"" actually keep you weak, making it harder to win. You're way better off leveling your gun and 1 or 2 skills up. But gun level ups are rare and you're regularly forced to select a skill you don't want, detracting one of your 19 chances of leveling up your gun or skill that you want. Without this negative affect, I'd give 5 stars and spend $. EDIT It takes all week and playing the same mission 80 times to beat the next mission. Boring. Down to 1 star and deleting game.",,,
"Have potential, would gain a star if the game allows the user to direct their shots. For skills, it could be either autoaim or... if possible, implement a system where I can mark flags for the 4 different skills to fire from/at. But in terms of firing controls, minimum id love to see is controls for the default attack. Lastly, it would gain another star if players could select the skills to bring in. If that's easy, maybe players have to select some (not all, unlocked) skills to bring in.",,,
pretty cool game but I can see it's all about how much you spend. gotta fight the same levels 20 or 30 times to be able to pass it.... and the milestones are barely enough for the next level unless you buy the special packs,,,
"Fun little game. Like many, growth does stall out a bit. Waves can be a bit repetitive and success is often dependent on random things. Even with those negatives it's a fun time waster just trying different combinations.",,,
"Probably the best line defense game on the store atm. Co-op makes it stand out. Regular updates don't hurt, either. I've only experienced one bug since starting 10 days ago (Mid-May 2024) and that was due to a network connection with someone playing Co-op with me from halfway 'round the world so it wasn't even really a bug. I give an average of two 5* ratings a year. This game deserves it.",,,
It's ok. NOT AT ALL LIKE THE AD. It's a shooter but you have no control of the gunner themselves just decisions on upgrades. Would give more stars if it was actually the game from the ad. That game looks good and is what I was looking for.,,,
"Ugh. Norton labeled this app malware, and I couldn't connect to a server. Then, after the update, my acct just completely restarted, and I lost all of my progress over the last few weeks. Sent a message to support thru the app days ago, but I never got a response. Shame, because I did love this game.",,,
"Super cool game, honestly. Didn't have so much fun in a while. Love the new updates. Also, you don't have to watch the ads unless you want to (it is beneficial for rewards however). Looking forward to new features. I would recommend that you remove the scrolling ""congratulations"" text (annoying, distracting & majority of players think the same). All in all, keep up the good work. 👍👏",,,
"It is a fun game. Different zombies, many skills to mix and use. The things that need improvement are gun AI aim priority(i.e. aim low HP enemies or etc). And I would suggest to maybe add skills like increase gun fire rate? But game is great give it a try! Hoping to see more improvement!",,,
I love the game and it's a great time waster my only problem is the damage increase I know I'm picking the weapon +60% damage and other means of increasing damage but it still takes the same amount of shots to kill an enemy so like you start of normal it takes say 3 shots to kill I increase damage by say altogether 300% but it's still taking 3 shots to kill the enemy? please sort this out.,,,
"I love the game!! I'd suggest adding an (i) or ? Button to each feature, I am at 26th level and got to know now what the road map of game is, exploring should be the 1st hand experience for new players, also ad 👍, paying 😞, lesser costs get more players for sure.",,,
"Why is it that in order to guarantee a win, every time, you have to hard focus your main guns upgrades. The abilities are useless, pgrading them is a waist and for some reason upgrading your gun is the ONLY way to win unless you're over leveled which is a painstaking grind.",,,
game wise is good. but I think the rng is really killing it. only 4 slots for skills where are lots of skill options to decide. may consider to provide players with a option to fix the 4 combos they want to use and upgrade as the game progresses. 10 over shots just to kill 1 monster. my godness,,,
"fun game so far. not pay to play, but pay to progress faster. the one thing I would love to see is the pop up messages of what other people achieve. don't care for that. it covers up the mechanics in the ui and is quite annoying.",,,
"Unable to do anything when the greeting gift pops up when starting the game. X to close doesn't work, hitting the buy option does nothing, just sits over the screen preventing anything to be done. Telling me to access something in game doesn't help, I can't access anything.",,,
one of the best games I have played in a long time. however the main thing I would like to see implemented is a endless mode horde fight that gets tougher the farther you go. also have your stamina increase you level up so you can play more missions as you get a higher level.,,,
it's a solid game and easy to play while doing other things. Just way to damn expensive with the in game shop. It's basically $30-$60 dollars for big upgrades. if they just cut that down to 1/4th the cost they would probably make way more than that off me Lol,,,
"Pretty standard pay to play game. After a few hours, you will hit a brick wall and will need to spend money to progress. That or spend a week watching ads and failing missions to move on. Was fun for a bit, but I can't see it keeping my interest much longer.",,,
"Everything depend on your luck, the more skill you unlock the more harder for you to get the skill you want. It should had feature for disabled certain skill so level up will not show the skill. And the gun are useless after 10th floor above, everything depend on your skill. The chance to get gun upgrade totally rare as in ultra rare, where by you can just keep your gun at lv 1.",,,
Boooo!!!...as usual...first few stage was good to attract players...as you go further into the game...you will see all your upgrades are useless and nonsense...those that u need won't appear but those useless ones will appear...first few stage...kill 4 zombies get to upgrade...later part of the game...kill 8 zombies still never get to upgrade...and best of all...your damage is lower then the zombies generate🤣🤣🤣...bloody nonsense game...will uninstall soon...piece of advise... don't download..,,,
So far I'm really enjoying the game. I like that you didn't try and squeeze in some base building BS. But I will say that there is a severe lack of explanation regarding the way equipment and gems merging and upgrading works. I find myself guessing if what I'm doing going is right. But other than my own stupidity the game is great.,,,
"Fun gameplay, good time killer. As a beginner using the armored truck, when you get more than 1 truck it is a bit annoying as they follow each other 50% of the time. Would be great to see that addressed.",,,
"Overall, the game is pretty good. My only real complaint is that battles feel a little slow. I think it would feel a little better if the base speed of the game was closer to the 1.5 speed that can only be used after completing the level at least once.",,,
"Edit II: UNINSTALLING THIS GAME SCAM!!!!! They didn't solve my problem at all and gave me no useful answer whatsoever. Edit: I sent them an email and they responded saying I should get in touch with their support, which I did and didn't solve anything!!!! THIS GAME IS A SCAM!!!!! I made two purchases and haven't been able to receive any. When I try to claim it, the game just freezes and nothing happens. Don't download it!",,,
Enjoyable time waster. All adds are combined with rewards. IGPs just save time and aren't nessecary unless you're impatient. Only complaint is that the game needs a bit better of a tutorial as it dumps a lot of menu things on you with no explanation.,,,
Well..this game absolutely hard to progress since the mobs are quitely strong even for the weakest one..need alot of farm&repeat previous level..the one thing should devs fix is the auto aim..player can't aiming freely while in duo mode co-op..and pls fix the cd all abilities and more reward for f2p...maybe why not give a little penny couple bundle or else for support devs improving the game..so far this game have some potential..,,,
Fun game but takes some grinding to progress to the next stage. I would like a better multiplayer invitation system as it's not always prominent that you have been invited to play. the announcement banner of when players get special loot gets annoying.,,,
The banner that says when someone gets an item and announces it to the server gets in the way of skill descriptions when you're in battle. Also the times for Boss monsters are inconvenient for my location the server that picked for me should have been selected according to my location.,,,
the only problem I have is that as ur leveling ur getting the gems to make ur build but ur also u locking a multitude of decreases the chances of pulling the skill types you need. this slows the game down alot as you are constantly repeating missions in hopes that u will get really lucky draws.,,,
"cool game ,would be a lot better if u can control where u want to place some of your special attacks. it should still be automatically used if not manually used. but there should be a manual option available to place and use the attacks once it have been recharged",,,
it's perfect! it's so good I want to keep playing it! it's a little difficult but I always get back up and I always kill the zombies getting perfect runs without getting hit is challenging but honestly it fits it,,,
"Original 3* 10min in. Gameplay ist Fun so far, that is whenever the game figures out how to use the internet. Massive connection issues preventing me from playing 50% of the time Update: Week in or so. Still fun. Still a bit unresponsive when starting application and your internet isn't perfect. During gameplay good enough, even for co-op.",,,
"Good game but there is some good still left on the table. Start with the easy one, change the number value from 1500000 to 1,500,000. Secondly, it is hard to upgrade specific skills during gameplay. I suggest the highest at least be an option and 2 random ones when you finish a level of monsters.",,,
no details given on the core skills before unlocking it and the difficulty on clearing higher level is extremely high unless you reload high amount of money. if you enjoy playing the same stage over a long period of time then the game may suit you,,,
very fun game the play modes are neat it's still just like all the others but I rather enjoy this one more. it could use some added features in the guild definitely need to earn just a lil bit more gold in game. and you need to be able to earn weapons and armors and new skills. and a few items to upgrade them and then just sell the parts to upgrade them for money. make a multiplayer area that is endless and you can earn some type of upgrade materials and make new skills off of teammates skills,,,
This game blows. Total money hole. No skill involved. All luck and no strategy. You will waste weeks on one level. Just because the game won't give you the skills you need to win. Mercenaries are horrible. They don't help at all. I acquired one that hurt me by bringing monsters closer faster. Completely disappointed in this game. Don't waste your time and certainly not your money. This game is pay to play. Choose another game. Spare yourself the frustration.,,,
Adverts never play. Always get an error message. Seeing as watching adds is part of the daily missions and other events I'm missing out on vital rewards. Shop prices are plain greedy but the base game is pretty good.,,,
Interesting game but I don't really have time to play and the levels take too long to play. It would be better if default speed is 1.5 and 2 after you beat the level. I would give 5 stars if you change that.,,,
"Very fun game. Challenging and no ads. My only complaint is the stupid banner that scrolls across your screen, congratulating other players on the server for their chest pulls. I can't think of anything I am less interested in than other players' loot. The banner is constant and annoying. If you remove it, 5 stars.",,,
"So far the game is really fun, it would be nice if the elite levels would give increased rewards compared to now, and double that increase for Solo completion of elite levels. Gold does feel a little grindy to obtain, I usually end up spending what gold I managed to save on upgrades just to survive, which I understand is the whole point, but a solid increase would be great. I look forward for the future of this game and the updates to come.",,,
"it is a great game. It looks like they are building and adding new content. hope they add an endless round. maybe I just haven't unlocked it. Maybe a guild system and be able to request the different upgrade laser/ ice bomb, etc... nice features so far.",,,
way too many material needs. Made explicitly to micro purchase you to death. needs a premium buy on e option to be a real enjoyable game. cool concepts based around bending plays over a barrel and getting into their wallet. just play a console game,,,
"Survivor game, but you just choose skills. No walking around, auto-attack no aiming, no active using skills. You just choose upgrades. Has various equipment, quests, and upgrade options most survivor games have.",,,
"It's an exact copy of Doodle Magic: Wizard Vs Slime but with bigger budget and different aesthetic. I prefer the original design but this studio put a lot of effort. It's fun, needs to spend some money otherwise you can't possibly play. Great work.",,,
Addicting tower defense game! So much to do and so much to level up! My only complaint is I downloaded this due to an ad displaying a Monkey D. Luffy skin. I have seen no mention of this so far and have reached lvl 12. Otherwise a great game to pass time!,,,
this game started fun. then a paywall hit literally. popped up spend 3.99 couldn't exit on click to pay. I exited the game restarted deleted reinstalled nothing fixed the problem goodluck. as I stated I can't do anything in the game I'm blocked by a pay tab that I can't edit from. so I'm unable to click the support.,,,
"I just lost my account forever. I was level 63 and ranked in the top 20. Was number 4 rank for about a week. Now it's all gone. Grinding from day one all for nothing. I got a new phone and tried switching my account over. Accidentally ""binded"" to Google. Now my account is erased. What a massive waste of my time. Rant over",,,
"It's a skin over Doodle Magic. Basically. Zombies are the slimes. Wolves are the rats. Even the weapons act the same way. Not bad, but not original either... Never said I had a bad experience... Nice generic response. You clearly didn't want to be embarrassed or just actually don't pay attention to your reviews. Good to know who I'm dealing with.",,,
"great time killer! UPDATE: Ended up being a typical pay-to-win after lvl 9, doesn't really matter what you do. All weapons feel ineffective. spent 5$ for nothing. I've wasted so much on ""quick patrols"" probably hit that 100000 times, and my weapons still suck? No thanks. un-installed.",,,
"so far I'm enjoying this game very much. but what annoys me is the elite matching, I'm constantly having team mates drop and leave me soloing it, I don't get the torches for finishing it, and they don't get punished in some fashion.",,,
"If you request a refund, you will be banned! It was all good until yesterday spent some money as usual, it didn't work as expected, requested a refund then got banned. To get back my high level account I have to repay the useless item. And all the other purchases were gone. What kind of business these guys are running! They can just say no refund, instead of holding your account as hostage. Uninstalled!",,,
"love this game but can get expensive, do to wanting different players or weapons. shouldn't be so much money for there items for one but love the game. ALSO didn't know about the different server's so can't play with my brother and kids it won't caring over 😞 be careful of sever u choose make sure family is on same one before paying money.",,,
Editing my review down to 1 star just for the terrible balance. As you progress you unlock skills that clog your choices. The skills all suck. You only want gun skills 99% of the time. Gun skills should just occur naturally with the upgrades to the gun and the gun skills should be removed. 5 gun skills are better than all 20 level ups in any skill. Booboo. Boring bad rng gameplay.,,,
honestly I was very skeptical about it was like another typical other shooter game app like every other one on the games store but honestly this one lives up to its advertisement and reputation 5 out of 5 stars but could use a little bit of maintenance on the watch for rewards I have watched two videos and I have not cleaned my rewards but all announced still a 5 out of 5,,,
"it's very similar to the ad except one thing l, there is no one punch man it's just a basic soldier. u run out of energy and can only watch 3 adds so they pretty much force u to pay to play the game. delete after playing 6 hours.",,,
"Great premise let down by rng. Unfortunately, if you don't get the rolls you need within the levels then quite often the level is impossible. No skill needed, just luck with the rolls. Otherwise it's quite an entertaining game to a point.",,,
I really like that the ads for the game are not intrusive. and I love how each new level makes you feel hopeless to start but the more you go at it the better your gear gets and seeing that tipping point every time is kind of a rush.,,,
Its a really fun game and I would of gave it 5 stars but for one reason I put it to 4 stars. The reason is that after playing the game for about more than an hour the game just seems to exit me out of it. Idk if its a bug but if is I hopr it gets fixed.,,,
"The game is full of bugs and won't start without several attempts. I made a purchase, but it was processed several times. I want it all refunded, but the developers aren't responding. I do NOT recommend this garbage.",,,
"Games has good points, no forced ads is also nice but like all games of this type its all about luck of what items come up for you to select and in elite mode i always get a player so far above me that they cause all the damage and its boring for me as i hardly get a shot in",,,
Game is good but could be better. It's not optimized fully so it crashes semi often when there's too many enemies on screen especially during abyss trials so I don't get the full reward.,,,
"this game copied another game, cant remember the name warts and all. it does have better stuff but the ludicrousness of having ur attacks uncontrolled and attacking the furthest enemy when ur gates are attacked is the worst part of the game. moreover many of the skills are useless and this is more like a game of luck than anything.",,,
"Great gameplay, but you need to be able to acquire more stamina so can play more often. Even a free option with reduced rewards. I find myself wanting to play more but being severely limited by the lack of stamina",,,
"This is probably the best TD game i have played. It is easy to learn,and has many quest to help level your character and gun/abilities quickly. I am really enjoying this game. Awesome job Devs,Mods,and anyone else who put time into making such a enjoyable game.",,,
It was good at the start but as you unlock new abilitys it becomes impossible to focus on upgrading one ability in game because a bunch of random upgrades you don't want show up so you just end up with a bunch of random upgrades and no actual power,,,
Slows down after a bit and the grinding starts. Then the frustration from the luck of the draw with the skills you need that you don't get to beat a level. But has me coming back everyday to try my luck lol.,,,
"its a simple game, not difficult to use, easy to understand. you have gear; level up system; upgrades; skins; weapons; and a cool companion with cool utilities. No problems so far",,,
Enjoy this well enough. A bit frustrating that most powers seem to prioritize enemies that i've already killed 90% with the terrible standard gun. Far too much grinding necessary to pass levels.,,,
"All the overlays keep breaking the game. Can't actually play the game, because I get an ad asking me to pay 0.99 for something in game, and the X button to make it go away doesn't work. So, I can't get out of the screen asking me for money.",,,
It's not a bad game so far. If you don't get lucky with gem pulls. I don't really care for the way they force you to pick a skill of something you don't wanna play with. Wish you could choose which 4 skills you wanna play with (within level of course).,,,
Simple and fun. I enjoy it. But quickly devolves into needing real money to progress unless you wait for energy to return. Too many skillss make your choice skills hard toget in combat making leveling up certain skills worthless.,,,
"decent game , needs some polish. as far as I can tell (correct me if I'm wrong) there is no way to access an options menu when you're in a battle. Secondly, the basic gun seems by far the best. Hopefully upcoming patches will improve this. I really appreciate that the ads are optional and not totally in your face.",,,
"The game is fantastic! I didn't give it 5 stars because, if you leave the game mid battle there have been instances where I couldn't not continue the battle. It forces me to quit the match.",,,
It's all fake there's one character with skins and not different characters. Also there's few stamina to play it and you will wait 15 minutes to get 1 stamina and it not enough to play a game because it need you 5 stamina to play . It is all fake ads and game!!,,,
"i was getting through abbys with all the upgrades i want and i was going really far, then the game just decided to error me out. are you scared of people doing well in your game? that you have to use the error bug to stop them from progressing? it doesnt happen when they give useless upgrades",,,
"The latest update has made this game unplayable. The game loads and is stuck on the welcome screen, unable to click off the 'offers window. Using latest OneUI on S23 Ultra. EDIT: Can't contact you through ingame help as it won't load past the welcome screen. Uninstalled.",,,
"Great game. I recommend it. I have only played it for 3 days so far, thats the reason for 4 stars. I will update my review in a few days. Nevermind that. I remove what i said. Lost my whole accnt after changing phone. Lost hundreds of dollars here because of that. Dont play this game.",,,
"it's awesome and addicting, but it's translated poorly in some spots. just a few upgrades I don't understand the full lethality of because of the translation. other than that, solid solid game",,,
"it's fun, but too difficult to get special items. 0.3 percent is ridiculous. 1-3% for the rarest items it's hard enough for other games. let alone you'd have to spend 50 dollars just for 10 chests, at 0.3% that's 1500 Dollars just to get one item!",,,
very entertaining game. great design and easy mechanics. The rewards and leveling up system are both fast and fair( at the moment early on). Early days yet but enjoying it so far.,,,
"There is a ""draft"" ticker that constantly runs, obscuring part of the screen. It just mentions who in the world won whatever ""power-up/item while playing. (and I don't give a damn, it's distracting)",,,
Much fun with several upgrade aspects. Would give it an extra star if they removed that annoying and unnecessary congratulations bar in the middle of the screen while playing.,,,
"Not bad. Gets pretty slow the further you move on, so it may require some grinding of previous levels - Edited. It becomes strictly PTW unless you just enjoy not progressing and playing previous levels over and over",,,
pretty good game lots of grinding. they could make it a little easier to power up horror game levels. it gets pretty tough once you get to a certain point and don't spend money. still it is a good game,,,
"This is one of those game where it's actually really intriguing. In my experience the ads aren't required every 5 mins, but are optional for rewards faster. The game itself is also really well polished, (though the UI can be slow sometimes or it's my A50 Android Galaxy [7 years old]).",,,
"A really enjoyable game. Heavily p2w. You can't farm premium gems without paying. You cannot reroll bad gem affixes without paying. Pay for weapons, skins, guns, mercenaries, drone skins, fort skins etc. everthing is behind a paywall, an expensive pay wall. £100 for a random skin. £100 for a random weapon. Everything is an average of a £100 and random. at these prices items should be chosen. Skip this game. Asian players top up from their private website and get better prices and deals",,,
"Trash game, if you don't get enough gun upgrades. Your run us scrubbed. Thats a waste of 5 stamina out of 30. + The 15 per day if you watch videos. I don't know how this has 1 million plus downloads when theres tons of better games on the market.",,,
"The game has potential, but the interface doesn't make sense. After winning a few levels it becomes impossible to advance further because I become overwhelmed with zombies.",,,
Addictive gameplay. Only new to the game. the Co Op mode is a nice featuee. Not sure if more people can join as you progress levels. that would be pretty cool for challenge modes.,,,
"the energy seems like too many,cannot finished....why don't making like.....10times energy for a single battle. it's ok for me if like this. more challenging because once lose means lose 10 times hahaha",,,
"Updated review: I lost my account when I got a new phone and my old one was out for service. Customer support emailed me and got me back into my account after proving it was mine. Despite early frustrations, they are excellent and this is a great game. Updated to 5 stars.",,,
need an easier way to earn morphs and better gear. trying to lvl up the character in the game gets extremely difficult and makes it hard to enjoy the game. I don't even receive gear when I do elite missions 😑,,,
"Pay to win game, first the skill is random and when you unlock lv10 skill still random and hard to use it , so its useless. 2nd , if you want what skill you want to use.. need to topup so much money.. so its pay 2 win. Bye2 for pay 2 win games like this.",,,
"really good game has great potential, however there is a bug in the game. The lightning strike ability (EM strike) goes further than the range it says it has, idk if it's a bug but this has good potential keep it up thumbs up so far",,,
"Do you want the kind of game that sends out enemies under others so you can't target properly? Have you ever wondered what an autistic monkey with a keyboard could create? Has there been a time in your life when you had too much money and wanted constant ads with no way to exit them? Well, this stinking hulk of flat garbage is exactly what you're looking for. No warning full face ads, regular micro transaction forcing money hungry company product that just lets you down in every way.",,,
"better than expected. this is the only game I play. makes it easier to put down. 😂 but updates and changes don't seem to happen often. IDK if it's my DooDoo phone, but it seems to not respond well to interactions 🤔? YYYEEESSSS INDEED very VERY VERY SOLID RATING.",,,
"Not too many adverts, those that are there are your choice to watch for 30 seconds if you want the small reward. I would say that even thou you don't need to spend money on it, splashing the cash will move you on quicker.",,,
I like the game. Good gameplay. The only thing I would change is the home screen layout. A banner that congratulates players for their achievements is covering the area that tells me what level I'm on.,,,
Challanges??? How come i cant manage single fight with bosses?? They never die. This is too much frustrating... it should be strong for limits... not forever???!! Kindly change this technique... it cant be like that forever or it will be useless and not funny game.,,,
"This game become boring after stuck at same level for more than 1 month, i cannot pass this level because i never get the combo skill i want. Well you need to pay to win for this game, without good item you cannot pass high level stage. Im free player so thats why its hard for me, penat dah main dengan macam2 cara tapi tetap tak lepas stage. Upgrade barang pun susah, nak dapat gem yang kita nak pun susah, drop rate yang sangat rendah membuat kan kita kena farming 1 stage begitu lama. uninstall",,,
"i could swear they purposefully made so that when you reach a level where some zombies have a special weakness (like ice), the option to pick any ice skill attack will never come to you. and sometimes you prioritise the wrong zombie. what a shame",,,
a very enjoyable game. the new features keep you interested in trying to get perfects on each of the levels. I would like some story to go with it.,,,
"losing the stage stamina would make this game more appealing, why would I want to play a game for a limited amount of time before I can play again? I want to be able to enjoy the game at my leisure not for a limited amount of time before I have to wait to play again, just a suggestion 🤷🏻‍♂️",,,
"Would love to see more strategy base option in battle arena, fighting is way too RNG and buying things is only way to progress to catch up levels. Generaly, great animations, good UI and overal gamey is good.",,,
Before i continue my review this is a message for the dev.. pls remove the mobile legend ad bcos the ad will force open the mobile legend game itself and force shut bang bang survivor.. ok here is my review. Game is good but if u are not paying u will lose interest after 2 weeks or a month cos u will stuck in the same stage unable to progress. U'll reach there eventually.. maybe after 4 years. So ask urself is it worth your time? But if you have cash to spare.. then y not?,,,
"Not much instructions on the game. You basically needs to learn things on your own. This somehow really reflects that the Dev lacks interest in the game. Also, poor game balance. P2W in you want to have decent fun.",,,
"You can't go past a point without starting pouring currency in, unfortunately for how much it plays well that's it, understandable but unistalling for the second time, and for good.",,,
fun little tower defense game however the weapon options feel very limited to start unless you purchase some and paytoplay isn't my vibe. other than that though it's a decent little game to pass some time.,,,
"Gameplay is mediocre at best, everything is $$$ optimized to a point that you can only get diamond from clearing stages without losing HP which taking days and hundreds of stamina and 50 diamond from daily quest, and daily quest only consist of 7 quest with no weekly quest or achievement.. Its not worth my time..",,,
The concept is fun and intriguing and it's a unique take on IO games but you'll struggle to progress as a person that's tried all features I have to say I'm a little disappointed I've bought loads and I've been stuck on the same level for about a week I contacted support for help but took them 7 hours to reply and within 2 hours of recieving that reply they closed my case without giving me time to respond it's pay to win and support is extremely rude id suggest another IO game imo,,,
"pretty good, just gets VERY grindy. The game will be great at some point, but it's still early and it's too hard because 90% of skills are useless at the moment.",,,
Absolutely garbage game! I spend hundreds of stamind to pass a stage?! I rarely get the right skills to be able to beat the stage?! all of this is just to force you into spending real money.. they're just trying to steal your money.. the game is where it belongs right in the trashcan,,,
"The game is a good distraction but needs more information or guidance/tutorial. As with most games like this, there is a strong push to spend money to upgrade and advance.",,,
Cant play with the new update ? What's up ?,,,
Gameplay is a little on the slow side. The graphics and performance are fine. The power ups are interesting. I don't understand why we can't play offline during a normal session.,,,
"not a bad game at all, time consuming. feels as though it's missing something though and the start-out grind is slow. other than that it's worth the download.",,,
Glutton boss. Comes every day. Right before I die and get points for my attempt. Screen freeze attempt is gone 0 points. Feels like a fun game. Boss levels suck. Just a waste of time,,,
"It's the same defender game but this time with zombies You hit a wall where you can't progress after a few hours, so spend some money to progress or wait for energy to grind the level over and over You know what my decision was? Uninstalling of course",,,
"Pretty nice game, without unnecessary commercials and stuff. Yes, there are some, but not intrusive ones, and certainly not mandatory. The game itself is well ballanced.",,,
"my only complaint is there's very little energy, vasicly you can play 6 rounds then your waiting for energy to play again, but a fun game. I'm glad there's no 10-minute tutorial that forces you to do things.",,,
"Really fun auto tower defense. Different weapon combos open up fun interactions. The only bad point is that it tempts you to spend $ everywhere. Otherwise, it's just a load of fun.",,,
"A reskin of Doodle Magic but I enjoy this better. Recommended. Devs: Get rid of the stupid announcement that runs across the top of the screen and block my view. I couldn't care less about ppl I don't know winning a level or whatever. Also, Gun may be OP.",,,
"Forced ads that won't close. Sucky game play. Almost have to pay to win lol 2 took 3 weeks to get past, for me anyway. Little to no instructions on how to play or use interface.",,,
"This is not a game, more like powerpoint presentation where you sit, watch and when the level is done choose an upgrade. What a waste of time",,,
When u first start playing the game it's super fun but as u get closer to like level 30 and 40 I've been on level like 38 forb2bdays and still cant get past level 20 idk but more rewards would really help dont have a whole lota money to spend so please try and make something possible please,,,
"Really fun game, and you get enough free / easily earnable stamina to play quite a bit. Other reviews complaints about so much of the game being locked behind paywalls is accurate. Still fun to play though.",,,
"Not a bad game. Would be 5 stars except... -1 star for being buggy and not responding to touch input. -1 star for that unbelievably annoying scrolling marquee that tells you what other random players ha e won. We don't care. No one cares. Fire whoever came up with the idea, then fire everyone who let it happen.",,,
"So far, it's been a lot of fun. Just a general time waster, but the progression has been smooth so far without the massive pay walls you see on a lot of other games of this genre",,,
pretty early on but so far really enjoy it the ads are t too bad or invasive and only $5 to get rid of them is great gameplay is fun and engaging as well if it keeps being this awesome ill likely go to 5 stars but like i said i am early on,,,
The game is great and needs a few tweaks to upgrades as well as a tutorial or the ability to manually pick targets but other than that I'm really enjoying it!,,,
Pretty fun game although it takes a very long time to unlock the fort and other things no typical of other games so -1 star for that but the skills are cool but would like to know how to get other skins.,,,
Always showing server full,,,
great game u can play it and do other things at the same time would like to see more communication options in multi-player the default 3 options aren't that great but good game 2 sink some idle time into,,,
If you like how rng feel like play this game you will feel that it all luck base on the skill if you do not pick the right skill out the bat you will lose 100% no matter what you do like that the main problem I have with it but other then that the game is ok but you be doing a lot of waiting to get powerful or pay money to speed up this there no between it if you ok with that play it if not move on to a better game,,,
"Great game, grinding doesn't feel like grinding. I Wish I could give more than 9 instances of stamina to my friends though. Also revamp the friends list so most active are at the top.",,,
"Pretty sweet so far. Like the upgrade style during game play. The character upgrade is cool, really like the gem inlay and upgrading. Haven't ran into any other play modes.",,,
"fun game, but the only thing I would say is that the enemies get good really quickly, and the gifts and rewards system will treat you like a noob, even when you're like, level sixty.",,,
"Highly Entertaining. Shame the adverts don't play, it restricts daily challenge completion. Maybe a simple fix is to remove the quest from daily.",,,
Would give 5 stars if only have quick play (instant finish game) to quickly diminishes the stamina. Have too many stamina but don't want to waste time on clicking to every map/level...,,,
Awesome game with good gameplay. You need to do good grinding to obtain stuff and purchases aren't necessary but can be helpful. Overall a well put together game.,,,
Very fun game but the service is poor. I can't finish events right now because of a bug in the game and it's been a week with no end in sight and no real communication. The hours I spent on the events were fruitless.,,,
Definitely love this game I play it everyday I built up a strong winning team of characters in I would recommend this to anybody,,,
"This company are spam, they steal my diamonds value $50 overnight. Slow customer service! Customer service try to avoid their mistake. Never refund my diamonds. Never want to spend anymore in this game. ADVICE DONT SPEND SINGLE PENNY WITH THEM!",,,
Hard to upgrade skill to the level i wanted. Super frustrating.,,,
always have network issues makes gameplay experience extremely poor.,,,
Scammers. This is a copy from the Chinese games and they have doubled the cost of diamonds on all events.,,,
"Lost all my data, countless hours of play. Do not recommend",,,
As described. Lacking guidance. There are things out there it just leaves you to just figure out.,,,
Disappointed and bad handling of your customer service. I paid for this game quite alot and I got myself at a quite level within 2 weeks of my playtime. Only 1 time I paid for the wrong purchase and I ask for refund thru apple store and I got it refunded. Thanks Apple. But I was banned by the game developer. I was told by their customer service that I had to pay for my wrong purchase or they will banned me till I pay for my wrong purchases. Look at my purchase history. I made so many purchases,,,
fun game mechanic and progression. viewing ads is not required and is not heavily forced on the player. at least not in the early stages that I've seen.,,,
Not really interesting. The grind is tough and despite making multiple upgrades to my gun the stats does not show. There is also no story to the game. The upside is you earn diamonds quite quickly.,,,
"id give it six stars if you had more options in the shop and stuff when you first start the game. but it's an awesome relaxing and fun game. I think this is the only game or app I've ever actually written a review for, so it must count for something",,,
"Sooooooooooooooooooooo boring! No loot, the only thing you get is gems to socket in gear. 1st level takes forever, approximately 20 minutes. After that, it takes forever to level up. Not worth my time.",,,
I like the game. Yet it's difficult to unlock levels without leveling up the character. Leading to repetitive chipping at replaying levels over and over. Or spend cash.,,,
Not much to say. Very good concept but pay to win unless you plan on playing for ever. Mechanics are extremely controlled and not at all skill based. Similar to raid shadow legends and all other skill less paid to win games,,,
"It Is a decent game but it is heavily a game of pay to win, even more so than most other mobile games, leveling and gearing up is so horrendously slow and boring without spending money.",,,
"Don't even want to try this game for the simple fact that one of your Ads on tiktok has literally ripped off the game ""That's not my neighbour"" (all they have done is changed one of the people to some anime girl but the numbers the D.D.D is the same lmao) before getting into what the game actually is just to gain more downloads.",,,
your little bot companion seems to target the area without any enemies most of the time. A way to get your companion to focus fire would make the game significantly better,,,
It was fun but I lost all my progress. Would give less stars after loss of progress as I had spent money. They unable or will to fix. No refund. Feels like a scam company,,,
"so far, it's a great and simple game! no forced ads and an excellent and clean ui as well as an equipment system that doesn't require 20 steps just to put new gear on",,,
game is okay. but it will always give you the wrong skills so that you can't win. and progress is super slow at hight lvl. p2w element is manageable.,,,
I think having the option to refresh more than once during a fight is important. feels like the choices aren't random in some matches.,,,
"pretty neat so far, will update later. having fun for now. too bad only 30 days for 5.99 for ad free. much rather pay 10 or maybe even 15 or 20 for full ad free plus some goodies every update or from time to time.",,,
A lot of the abilities unlocked feel weak and take up space to help one lose. Maybe you'll get lucky and upgrade the gun enough to win.,,,
"It's pretty good so far. No forced ads as of yet. And hasn't bombarded me with pop-ups. Pretty much, click to start and let it roll until you choose your upgrades. 👍",,,
"Played it for an hour, I couldn't progress without either paying money or keep losing at the same level until I can improve my gear enough to win. Not my kind of play style",,,
"So far, so good. Don't really mind the slow progression of skills/equipment, etc. Still on level 2, will see how things go.",,,
"It's not a bad game, but I saw an advert showing you could use Luffy? He's not in the game. I've lost my account because it automatically gives you a guest account. Uninstall then reinstall=account gone.",,,
it's fun but the adds are annoying as is in any free game tho but I like it I play when it's slow at work and it's very interesting it's not easy if u don't pay attention and if u pay to win u may be better off but I didn't.,,,
"A simple game basically. A tower defense where you're standing behind a wall and defending that wall from waves of monsters. decent amount of strategy, I recommend this game.",,,
Too many sub skills to pick from during a run. Some should be made as upgrades. Equipment upgrades are slow and clunky and not noticeable during game.,,,
"Fun, game plays it's self, but you choose skills during match. Out of match there's the customization process. Overall it's a relaxed, but fun game",,,
"Good game but if i log in my account on different device, even using link or email, my progress doesnt carry over to the other device. How do i fix it? -resolved by Devs. Must choose same server. Didnt notice that. Thank you!!",,,
it's a wonderful game but unfortunately when the ability work normally it shoots at a target which usually the nearest one but when the target dies with the rifle the ability shoots at the same spot which go away for no one I hope you will fix it,,,
really really enjoy the challenge of trying to figure out the right skills and strengths of skills to use on each level. Awesome tower shooter!!! if that's what it is,,,
the grind is real with this game. replay the same mission a lot of time to get very few resources which leads to some minor 0.0001% upgrade. rinse and repeat.,,,
"earlier game cant even stand with ton of enemy.skill really needed to improve.high hp & tons of enemy really need luck to get what skill ,but always bad lucks.getting useless skill cant even kill an enemy at early stage.",,,
"Highly RIGGED GAME!! Once you get to stage 5? You'll have to PAY TO WIN!! Or repeat levels 1-4 a hundred times and level. They're greedy about awards, too!! So if you want to waste time and get ripped off, this is the boring RIGGED GAME for you!!",,,
"I wish games would stop being a cash grab. This game has a lot of potential, but the server stalls out, and you run out of stamina quickly..... the gifts should be gifts, not real money used to get it.",,,
Interface bugs out on pixel 8 after logging in. This prevents me from starting the game unless I enable airplane mode. The reason for this is it prevents the popup ad for in-game purchases.,,,
"game is fun, but a real grind, especially the normal stages. I understand nightmare mode being hard, but kind of ridiculous for the normal stages. especially early on.",,,
the refresh function needs to be fixed. I shouldn't get the same 3 options when I refresh them. I suggest adding a code that temporarily removes the refreshed options from the draw pool until next level.,,,
"Im going to report this game. Progression is purely based on Bullet upgrades because support skills are not strong enough to progress so if your RNG code doesnt give out Bullet upgrade then you cant progress & from what I can see your RNG is programmed to not give bullet upgrades. I presume if I paid you money the RNG % would swing in my favour. Your game is busted,you cant have progression be so reliant on one upgrade type & program your RNG to have an ultra low chance of getting that upgrade.",,,
I think there should be a way to get energy back faster or at least be able to have a skill that makes it to where you can get more back. also same thing with diamonds. overall good game,,,
"Too many power ups, makes it dumb that you can get 98% on one level, replay, and fail the next. Needs to be a preferred power option. Really makes this game unenjoyable to just waste STM for 3 days on 1 level.",,,
Game stopped reacting after the second game. Load screen fine but no reaction from touch screen. Phone is fine in every other aspect. A shame since I paid for a couple of things in the game,,,
"the game is just the right amount of strategy and casual fun! the UI lags a bit, but aside from that, I love that there are 0 ads forced on you. get a 5 star just for that.",,,
"Could do better if the equipments gems have different types. Icons is a bit too small to spot sometimes. Overall, games kinda alright fun.",,,
"nice game, fast progression, just takes thought and planning for upgrades. Quick little $1 purchased unlocked a ton of bonuses and game became even more enjoyable. Definitely recommend.",,,
"very well done game. Some perk choices are much stronger than others and some balances need to be made but, for a fun, not to complex, roguelike game, it's really good.",,,
Bad this said that it had a luffy skin and it doesn't only ask about foreskins maybe six and terrible artwork very pixely super bad storyline bad reasoning we just get put into a thing with zombies and we're fighting just straight into the game you go into the game and you just are fighting zombies no storyline just like hey robot let's go fight some zombies,,,
"playing for a week. seems like a lot of stuff to do at later levels. no pay wall yet. fun and easy game to learn, harder to master.",,,
there's a scrolling message of people winning things from chests that scrolls across the screen which gets in the way of menu items and is impossible to turn off or move.,,,
This is pay to win when you have passes that can be bought with dimonds but no repeatable quests to earn dimonds and there are many other things wrong with this game and i know you all have my last review still and when i see people in stage 50 when this game has only been out for close to or a little over 2 weeks it is a pay to win game and dont even get ne started on you gifts codes because those codes gifts are an insult to the player,,,
Kudos to devs for compensating for lost connections w/o player prompting. I did a late night grind fell asleep woke up to a msg rewarding me for loss connection planned or not. Nice surprise! 👍,,,
So far the game is great. The only problem I've had so far is in the middle of a round. The text disappears so I have no clue what skill level up I'm picking.,,,
Fun game with lots of customisation. Levels become progressively more difficult and there is a co-op mode for grinding gear.,,,
"My only real issue is that when the enemy freezes, my laser stays on them. they should be untargetable until the freeze is over.",,,
buggy when starting sometimes I have to restart it multiple times. however playing is fun! cute graphics and easy game play!,,,
it is good tight now. not to many adds and it is fun to play. but it would be nice if the naruto gameplay what is in the ad for this game will be true and available easily . but it is just a fake ad.,,,
I really like the game and that the game gets you to play for hours with out even knowing it it's like addicted but that's what the game needs cuz other games play it for like 20 minutes and your done that why I like this game cuz of its action keep up the work thank you for making this happen from triston,,,
Stupid money hunger games. Too depends on luck for skill choices and need top up a lot to get better gear. Manual control on shooting is delay and suck !!,,,
"Amazing tower defense game! At first, the pacing seems a little slow, but then things start to get interesting with weapon/skills upgrades!",,,
Watched an ad that showed a really fun looking tech tree... Got into the game. No tech tree. There is also loads of micro transactions in the game. Do not recommend,,,
"Very bad experience, being continuous recharged for 2 days. The next day, account gone and couldn't find the progress anywhere.",,,
Always online gatcha game. Bad version of vampire survival or magic survival. It's one of very few games where you get worse the more you level up.,,,
It's a farming game. Progress takes time and repeating quests is required. After the 6/17/24 update I can't connect due to the version check error,,,
"I see no reason to continue playing this game beyond the first level if I am forced to start over from scratch. What's the point? There is none, once you complete the first level it's basically just repeating the same thing again",,,
"seems ok, takes a very long time to unlock anything interesting. also best build seems to be normal attack always, making other skills more annoying than fun to get",,,
"No real feel of the progress. You just get stuck on initial maps that look identical, and repeat them again and again for little bit of gems.",,,
"Loses connection a lot but restores quickly, the didn't even notice a lot of the stores placements and not sure I've found all of them lol, good game otherwise",,,
Nice grind game with idle and active playstyles. Server feature is a nice way to highlight your acomplishments vs other players who started playing arround when you did.,,,
"The game is alright, but please make it offline. I don't think games like this should be just online games, since all you do is kill a horde of monsters. Good game though.👍",,,
Awesome game. it would be nice to have a log sheet of what skill upgrades you've chosen for each battle. And more gems fro each battle. I feel its not balanced. Thank you.,,,
Wish I could focus on more single ability upgrades during dungeons. I always seem to get what I need when it's to late.,,,
I love this game. It is very rewarding and there are no obtrusive ads unless you choose to watch one for rewards. I highly recommend.,,,
"Game has potential but very sloppily implemented. Forced team play but ""teammates"" leave the match before the button comes up and denies you your torch rewards. Not many US player, just toxic Asians and Russians.",,,
very nice game to play. but the level up system for weapon and equipment was very hard. hope can do some adjustments on that. other than that. nice game to play.,,,
"Doesn't load, just says under maintenance since launch. Save your time it's another ai generated money grab I'm sure... Just more access to devices is all. Steer clear Company has 1 app that doesn't work from launch and claiming world leading LAUGHABLE Edit; how do you contact in game when game will not load, developer? Seriously lame.",,,
this game is good but could get cleaned up a bit the watch a video option is on an almost consistent botch it makes me watch then I get no benifits even tho I just waited 90 seconds and for what normal rewards that I didn't need to wat h the video for after all?The game asthetically a good game tho spent hours playing4 of 5,,,
It's fun but if you don't get the best possible ability rolls you won't finish with full health. Wish everything was more viable.,,,
"The game looks and plays just as I saw on tik-tok, smooth game play and lots to do! My only complaint is I've been trying for a month to get a forest feather to no avail lol.",,,
At level 5 you will have to repeat it quite a few times in order to level up enough to pass it with a perfect. Unless you spend money,,,
great game. one minor improvement would be to use a font for co-op battle damage that makes it easier to compare the battle damage.,,,
"100% pay to win. Very disappointing. I've spent a lot of money, and just as I said you can't pass another level without buying more. Wish I could get back the 100 dollars I wasted.",,,
"The game is fun, but the levelling up feels a little slow. It makes the game feel stale after a while.",,,
"I give 4 stars just for now because I only played a little. This game defo has potential for 5 stars. There are a lot of interesting design choices in this game. I'm excited to explore them, and that's rare these days.",,,
"Games awesome, love playing every bit of this game. Only issue I have is the lack of a Vip system. would be super siked to see one implemented.",,,
Love the game... Is there anyway to make an offline version? Obviously won't be able to connect to the other players. But to play just stages? I just don't have anyway to get internet at my house or else I would play it a lot more than what I am!,,,
"overall more fun and satisfying than every other survivor game ive played thats like this, i really like seeing the damage just spill out the enemies all over the place. very fun",,,
game is rigged. always choose useless upgrade in game. hard to play unless u pay to buy the item. quite boring. uninstall very soon,,,
"Fun and interactive, multiple things to do on the home page, many different upgrade aspects. Overall a really good game",,,
"good game, bit slow to progress levels. the truck likes to stick to the side of the screen when it appears, should be more mid focused imo. so be mindful when picking that option.",,,
This game is pay to play. Takes forever to level up and the stage difficulty has exponential growth. Be prepared to spend a lot of time or money.,,,
slow zombie progress and game locks speed controls until you beat the level once but once you beat the level there is not much reason to play it again,,,
Fun game but I'm stuck on an inactive server with no way to move servers and there is no functional chat option to socialize with the few left on this server.. might as well make this a single player game Edit: Dropped from 3 stars to onebfor their generic reply,,,
"Fun, pretty simple, interesting cutimization options, definitely worth giving a try when you need something to be mindless.",,,
Good time killer. Sometimes wouldn't start though. I'd have to clear it from the RAM and restart to get it going.,,,
fun little bit of a date night with the girls and it's not a fan of both of them but I was wondering how you would be able to make a mixtape for the price of the other day and the bruiser thing that was a little over the weekend and then I just wanted to make sure you had the material for a few things that you wanted to make and get it to you as much around the holidays as a neophyte year drive safe trip and you could have done it yourself with the removable hardtop of the house that you were,,,
can you please make it easier to upgrade skills that we want ?? buff other skills if not ? game is so unreliable. i cannot get the one upgrade i want despite playing like 15 games in a row 😂,,,
I think we need a bit more control over how our skills / gun are used. The game is engaging but feels a bit too much like a fish bowl right now,,,
upon starting up the game freezes sometimes and I have to shut everything down and restart. other than that good game.,,,
"5 stars for the sincerity, the game is exactly how it looks in the ad. a bit rough though and could be an excellent game once polished",,,
personally much better than the doddle magic game or whatever it's called. this is much more player friendly. not to mention the reloading aspect makes the game more intense.,,,
"honestly it's not bad, it takes some thinking depending on where your at in the game, but it still feel like it's missing something, I just don't know what, overall tho I recommend keep up the good work guys",,,
"It loads, but I can't play it. I've uninstalled it installed it and it didn't work. It gets to the main screen and then i touch the screen and nothing happens",,,
"Great game but not enough gold to level up heros and skills. This makes the game drag out, and needs a x2 speed for elite levels.",,,
"Fun game, although I do feel abit scammed, since I downloaded this game, seeing a me ha like gundam in advertising. Still, it's pretty fun. Still haven't gotten lucky with skins, but so far, so good.",,,
"Little energy given, pay pay pay, upgrades once in a blue moon. Impossible to progress if u dont spend money, think before installing.",,,
seriously enjoying this simple tower defense game. the upgrade combos are randomized leading to defense strategies I didn't build for but are surprising and fun.,,,
great game! If you're looking for an entertaining time waster this is it! it would be nice to see how much damage your mercenaries and wall do though,,,
"broken game. load screen advertising buying a weapon is broken and can't get to game. closed and opened multiple times, still stuck on advertisement weapon",,,
I think game would be better if upgrades to your abilities had an explanation of what it does. example I don't know if plus to hit is good cause no explanation of what it means,,,
"My account was charged for over 200 because of my son and can't request a refund via google pay. I can't' believe this has happened as I need that money for food shopping. I have logged on to find there is no game content even now, Total rip off.",,,
"Trash. You cannot choose where to aim or when to fire, and you can't place or move your character. You choose upgrades. That's it.",,,
"you need to add the 3 more core bots to the bottom of the screen, instead of on the right side. you can barely see what level they are, and it would look better with each core having one power.",,,
"Haven't been playing for long, but enjoyable so far, keeps me entertained on my breaks at work, kills time, easy enough to understand, will update in the future!",,,
i like it. as a suggestion it would be nice to be able to prioritize the kind of enemy you prefer for an attack ability to attack first,,,
its a good game nicely made no adds unless you want them witch is nice just wish we could pick a set of powers for a wave so we dont get so many random chance like the tanks out of 20 games never got the upgrade for the tanks other then that nice game,,,
"plays similar to the app, no wall stuff more of a tower defense, but casual game play almost like an idler. it's fun. Eventual pay wall hits hard, but that's mobile gaming for you.",,,
not bad. fun little time waster. doesn't have forced ads. some of the skills are pretty fun. make sure you use the free codes.,,,
"Well it is a decent game and I'm enjoying it, but there is a lot of pay to win in it. As a free to play player you need a lot of patience and look up gift codes",,,
"this game is about luck. you have to try many times to get your combination. but they limit the new stage game speed, it's wasting people time. irritating design.",,,
"Good time waster over all, but need to fix drone assault duration in fights, after getting multiple duration increases it disappears early while the skill timer is still counting down",,,
it's a good game but there is a gold coin chokehold. after upgrading a bit everything is a few grand and you only make a few hundred per run.,,,
"Decent game for a few weeks, A little grindy, but you don't really need to spend any money on it. Doesn't shove adds in your face like others.",,,
"honestly this game isn't that bad, as I thought as this game would be full with ads, it only has ads for rewards. quality of the game is pretty good.",,,
"It is not like the ads. I hate it. I am deleting it for not being like the ads there, not like it ads that interrupted my session when I played the game, and I hated it so much, but my sister hates it to",,,
"Good game, but very slow leveling up. There's a lot of replaying already beaten levels to progress further.",,,
"It's nice, you can progreed being a f2p and the multiplayer is simple and fun. The worst part is that it takes way too much to progreed without p2w.",,,
Great game for killing time. Gives enough challenge to keep you interested but not too difficult that it causes frustration.,,,
started play and can't stop now its fun but I really wish you could keep the levels on the weapons for each stage but still a good game.💯🔥🔥🔥🥳🎉🎊,,,
it's ok for a game you just sit and watch. the upgrade is a little unclear. the upgrades in battle are a little weak,,,
"Honestly a pretty fun game, not as p2w as you might thing more rng based on your playstyle. I like the gear system but maybe the gear can do a bit more, however im pretty early in the game so maybe late game gear is insane.",,,
"getting a bit repetitive, and most useful items are behind a paywall. but still a good bit of entertainment",,,
pretty fun and decent game so far. the difficulty spike from level 1 to level 2 is a little bit outrageous.,,,
"I love this game, helps me get thru my 10hr overnights. The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars is the fact that I spent $29.99 on your Supreme bundle and never received it.",,,
"extremely difficult to progress without sinking money into the game, alot of money because everything is ridiculously expensive.",,,
it's fun but the energy system limits you greatly only giving so many battles before you're forced to wait. either increase the max energy or lower the cost per battle because I honestly wish I could play more without waiting,,,
"So far after 1 month, it's still fun. Having to grind a little to be able to upgrade the weapons. But not a bad time burner.",,,
not bad. Im just not sure if you can get the really good gear without paying for them... could use some explanation on what you can get out of chests... just gems or can you also find new minions to help?,,,
Great game but frustrating at times as some flying/ranged enemies can't be targeted by skills automatically so have to rely on your gun,,,
Highly addicting game. Would love to have the ability to copy character gem setup from one character setup to the others.,,,
This game has been very addicting from the start. I still play my other games but I have to remind myself to play them cuz this is the first one in the morning & the last one in the evening.,,,
"it's good, but I just wish VIP was better. why give me 2x if it's only after I beat it? It should be allowed when just trying to beat the level. not afterwards trying to 3 start it basically. overall good game to chill",,,
even though all the ads don't accurately portray this game in the same way it is still pretty enjoyable and has a familiar combat and skill upgrade system,,,
"minus having to wait so long for energy to play the game, it's quite exhilarating to play. the team up option is very nice as well and actually enjoying playing so far. good game",,,
"fun , addictive game. some logics may need a slight attention as the companion and yourself always fire on same target causing wasted specials. other than that, lots of fun.",,,
"Fun little game, but not much customization available. Seems you are stuck with the same guy for a long time.",,,
the energy to do levels is kinda low and takes a while to recharge not a fan of energy based things really but it's not to bad if your a very casual player,,,
Best game! Though I lost my account through binding. i wanted to play on other device and try to bind then all my progress lost.,,,
Pretty nice game! Only thing that would make it better would be a tiny bit faster progression and more variety.,,,
Enjoy the game but servers are horrible. I am trying to play and this game constantly times out. The servers are seemingly in China and struggling to connect.,,,
i didn't want to like this game but I'm pretty addicted to it still a little confused by some of the things I have unlocked like bigger magazine but somehow I still have the same amount of bullets,,,
This game BLOWS Some rando company using other people's videos as advertising without those consent jus to push some copy and paste 2d unity mobile game. Also likely spyware if it needs access to your personal data and messages lmao. Don't install 🙏,,,
"the game is very fun and engaging,however part for stamina to play kinda mood killer. overall good game for time killer, hopefully stamina part can be adjusted in future as this can be annoying when u already absorbed but unable to do anything.",,,
"P2W with multiple 'slot machine' progressive systems that players must pay & pay, eg. gems, p2w skins etc. Multipe game passes for useless mats to play the 'slot machines' Gameplay is the usual grind via stamina. I dont understand the purpose of character building when gameplay only gives random skills?",,,
Honestly pretty fun! You can just keep doing the challenges and rewards to keep leveling.,,,
Fun to just sit back while doing other stuff. Progression is a bit slow and you really have to grind unless you spend real money.,,,
pretty fun but takes a long time to level up your skills and you should be able to purchase new weapons with game coins also,,,
if there was a more direct approach to different combos I can see instead of the car and Lazer then I would love it even more,,,
This game has surprised me. The gameplay itself is smooth and simple. The difficulty is just right and keeps you coming back for more.,,,
"A good game, though the difficulty of levels does ramp up rather quickly. Perhaps some boosts to skill or gem upgrades might help?",,,
"Fun, easy game to play upgrading is easy. Even if you don't want to pay money, couple videos and I gave you good chance to upgrade items",,,
it's good but way too hard to lvl up enough to go complete lvls especially attempting to get a perfect clear to get more rewards to lvl up,,,
"should remove the energy so we can keep playing. or make it shorter time. since the difficulty is there is challenging, but the energy is not enough.",,,
"very fun game. the home screen is a little cluttered, but the game is awesome, easy to play, and very fun!",,,
"I love the idea and the game itself. however, there is way to many commercials. You should be able to play without having a commercial in the way of the game.",,,
fun time killer! graphics are nice! Challenging but if you put in the time you will feel like you're keeping up. I wish people would chat a bit more...,,,
"impressed that the difficulty scales faster than most games, so the first few levels aren't freebies.",,,
"It's not a bad game, but progress is blocked about map 5. Then it's a grind to get anywhere. It's nothing like the ad, though.",,,
Images here do not show the game. All are misleading and are not to be trusted. If you are fine with that. Then play the game blind and decide. I refuse to play or pay for false games images on the app store.,,,
fun game but I wish they would take the congratulations crawl off the top of the screen since it's worthless information and just gets in the way of what we're trying to see during gameplay,,,
i like the way the ads can be watched by my choice and if you choose to watch you get a upgrade keep up the good work,,,
"Pay to play game, constant grinding, annoying announcement that can't be turned off. Better of playing Mousehunt, free to play passive game collect trap and base to catch mouse",,,
"not overly ad based, the game is amazing though, and the energy system allows you to play for a long time",,,
"after events, give us 24 hours to soend the materials i have saved until the end. just lost 2000 of the last week long credit. no clue it disappeared and couldnt spend them!",,,
"Pretty slow, the power ups are so random, i dont understand how other players make 30+ levels in a game round, since im stuck at 20.",,,
very fun time waster. The level mark to unlock certain things but other than that the game is extremely fun.,,,
"Good game, but the ads NEVER work, forcing me to reset the game every time I try them. Fix.",,,
fun game but the writing constantly going across the middle of the screen is distracting and makes it hard to read the buttons behind it,,,
the game is cool it needs more interaction though and it would be cool if there were more weapons and modes.,,,
Would like to see more blueprints for the skills that you use more. Random blueprints that I don't use suck to get.,,,
"would be 5 stars, but during the abyss challenge, since the tier difficulty stays the same, you don't get the same amount of upgrades necessary to even continue",,,
Spent over $100 on game. Kid was playing on phone and charged $50 more. Google refunded but these guys felt the need to ban my account for it. Lesson learned will NEVER support these devs again. Save money and just download a mod apk instead.,,,
fun game but the stamina regen is just not good you can play a few matches then have to wait an extensive amount of time before you can play another.,,,
really pleasantly surprised. Ads are entirely optional and paid extras don't feel forced at all. Early days yet but off to a good start!,,,
"Describe my experience??? After update, when login straight away bring us to buy a package, no matter want to buy or reject the offer the screen freeze on the package. so I think this game is dead..",,,
loading time to get into the game is slow. but overall very enjoyable and great to pass time,,,
"Love this game and would give it 5 stars if not for the ""network reconnect"" issues tgat started in the last day or so. Aside from that issue I love this game.",,,
It's way to hard to get through levels. you don't get enough resources to level up your player. might just un install,,,
"I am absolutely enjoying the game. It is not overly taxing on time, plus it doesn't have ridiculous dailies that just eat up your time. Great little casual title 🙏",,,
Doodle Magic clone but significantly more expensive. If you're looking to spend less than $300/month go play Doodle Magic instead Edit: customer service refuses to help you. Reduced to 1 star,,,
why pay to win or pretty much pay to play but a fun mindless game to enjoy I guess also why do I need to be level 50 to access basic things in the game to help me progress and not be stuck at level 12?,,,
a great game but when I look at the skin I don't see a option to get it but to buy it with real money I think you should make another game mod to get skin like battle a evil of ourselves or something else you can think of,,,
"this is a pay to win game, i've bought some thing but i've been stuck on level 15 for 3 days because i'm not buying the skin with +50 attack at 30$, all my gear is almost level 20 lol",,,
"After long day playing. Already bind to Facebook and gmail. Today is not my lucky day phone damage. Trying to login into another smartphone it success but need to play new. Sigh, wasted my 2 weeks playing.",,,
Stage progression is a little slow but stamina recovery is pretty solid. I recommend the ad remove pack for at least a month.,,,
Visuals are appealing. Fun and easy Game play. Quicker battles so you don't need to spend long time playing if desired.,,,
"played multi player for elite stage, player leaves the stage get the multi player credit but the ones left behind get nothing. How is this even fair? One star is all you'll get. If possible I'll give you zero star.",,,
"Not bad, looks as advertised could use a few more interactive elements in gameplay.",,,
"90% of the time it gives me network errors, which makes it so I can't watch ads or just do anything in the game most of the time",,,
I'm giving this game 5 stars because it's exactly like the ads said. It wasn't a minigame inside a building game or something like that.,,,
I am loveing the game. The only issue is that the start-up sometime 🥶 for a few seconds or just have to close and reopen the app,,,
it's enjoyable just a tower defence game. takes a while to progress naturally. seems like a nice game to play for 2 weeks or so,,,
This is a decent semi-idle game. I'm digging the power ups and the fact that you don't always get the same setup every game. Fun stuff so far.,,,
fun but needs a better tutorial. spent money on it a little. just to break through the 3rd-5th stage.,,,
game play is great wish there was another way of getting skins that we wanted like purchasing them for 29.99 or something 49.99 for the higher skins and weapons as well a package deal,,,
Could be good but forcing you to chose from skills that you hate ruins it if you could chose which ones you like it would be really fun.,,,
if you didn't have to pay to win it would be a better game. Games that are pay to win causes hatred to those who can't afford to be on top and you end up loosing more players then you keep,,,
"Very fun game. luck with rng is the key, so anyone can play this game. wish there was more chatting because it's a hard game to learn without using discord",,,
"decent game, too much to pay for but can be played for free, would like longer levels to see weapons advanced further",,,
great long term game. ads dont load. multiplayer needs work as invites and accepts dont work well. a tutorial woukd be nice. stick with it. very good game.,,,
"seems fun, good mechanics but ads on other platforms need to stop being anime based characters when there aren't any in game that I've found",,,
been stuck on level 9 for a while now it's kinda hard to level up to keep up with the on going levels,,,
"Games neat like the idea, but I've lost my save 2-3 times now. Not starting over every time I open the app.",,,
it is a typical shooting game...progress is fast for first levels then impossible without paying.,,,
Good game but skins give you extra abilities and they are hidden behind very low chance loot boxes so unfortunately its kinda pay to win Edit: they didn't even read the review,,,
Lost my game. Game basically started over. Tried to find my old server and nothing. I spent money on this game and it was all a waste. Deleting game.,,,
fun semi-idol game. a few modes with a decent challenge that seems well paced. enjoying it so far.,,,
"they need to make it so that I you get disconnected, it'll still give u the rewards you earned up until that point. it's a great game though.",,,
Game is unplayable. Won't go past the main menu. Can not connect to any servers.,,,
it's fun to play but needs more options for the player to do in the game. And can also add a few more characters tooo,,,
The ads are ridiculous is why I'm giving it a one star rating. They shouldn't be removable by paying a 5 dollar monthly charge. Maybe pay 5 bucks to remove them period.,,,
Incredible game. I'm very glad I found this entertaining zombie blaster. I will be enjoying this for a long time to come. Highly recommend this great game!,,,
Copy of the same mechanics as other base defense games. good animations. easy interface,,,
"Could use some extra free diamonds in the season progress and elite missions. Less skins on the premium packs, more focus on materials and gems to ensure stimulation, thus ensuring multiple purchases.",,,
Super fun and addicting. Very easy to be able to decide your level of engagement. Huge win.,,,
"Good game, but lots of things are directly copied from doodle magic. Would be nice to see more originality in the game in future updates.",,,
"Really fun so far, elite levels with friends, but can't access some servers and when you do it starts you over at level 1",,,
"The game keeps disconencting every 5-7 seconds. Way too greedy too. You should start spendign cash right from day 1. I do not mind paying, but I mind poorly maintained servers",,,
it's a decent game however its very repetitive and monotonous. need to add more events and things to do then I will up the stars.,,,
it's pretty addictive. just like the ad I seen too. kinda slow leveling but maybe I'm not doing something right.,,,
Hard long grinding game. Upgrading takes a long time to power up your weapon to handle the waves.,,,
Good little game gets hard but you still want one more go. And it's rewarding when you clear that level,,,
"Fun game, but it's a pay to win game Progress becomes very slow, no progression by ads you have to pay ridiculous amounts to have fun",,,
Great game only issue so far is the adds have stopped working so I can't get more energy to continue playing (have to wait for energy).,,,
the games not bad its a good time killer game. but was disappointed 5hat the game turned out to be click bait showing off characters that wasn't part of the game,,,
"The game Was okay until I logged in one day and can't get past a pop up asking me to buy a pack. Can't close it, can't play the game. Bye.",,,
"very challenging, could use better tutorials but fairly easy to learn on your own as well",,,
"it's okay, upgrades are mostly pay to win, it can pass the time, but it's just okay.",,,
Overall good game. Wish you were able to increase the amount of ammo your rifle can hold.,,,
it wpuld be a great game if it wasnt for the cash depot you have to put in. all in all worth having to kill 2-3 weeks of your time.,,,
"This game has nice features but will need you to grind and grind to get it, encompasses tough challenge to get to the treasures!!",,,
feel like rewards need to be more rewarding and energy for playing the actual game should be increased but not a bad way to pass time,,,
No cancerous ads. A bit slow progression and unclear menus but a solid game.,,,
"Takes FOREVER, almost impossible to level up . Makes you want to uninstall. But really fun. .",,,
"I have lost my account, changed my phone, i have spend money on it and there is no chance to recover account",,,
"Nothing like the trailer on the store page. Far slower, and a lot more boring.",,,
A game that's fun for whales and no one else. Most servers are populated by the top 20 paying players and every one else quits in a week,,,
"Poor execution on account linking. Lost all progress, unable to get back old account.",,,
Greedy devs. Some events are only for real money. Some game stuff is just impossible to get without spending money.,,,
"All good. except, i cannot play ad on my phone Vivo 1906 ""fail to play the ad()"" message shown. pls fix this.",,,
no forced ads. pretty grindy. very RNG dependant. I wish I had some influence on what upgrades appear in missions.,,,
Game is well balanced in my opinion. With a little bit of grinding you can progress in this game.,,,
Nice game easy to uninstall 👍,,,
"F2P is a grind, most players seem to put in money. be warned you'll be farming the same level 15-20 times plus just trying to level up and get gear.",,,
"Fun game. I wish there was a way to pick what abilities show up in the roulette, but otherwise it's a fun time.",,,
Very good at killing time. Scales quickly to being difficult to clear levels,,,
Ye ye mighty Bruce there's plenty more fish stix were that came from. Just make it snappy and wakeup happy merry Xmas I'll see u with the shoes and the pants... Rocksteady I gotta make sum spghetti,,,
"Game is fun to kill some time, only wish is for you to be able to control where the character is shooting at.",,,
Recently changed phones and haven't been able to transfer my progress over. The linking process need to be simplified,,,
"If you want to win on this game? Very easy, just pay!",,,
too hard for beginner.. there's no you can pass all the level easily without spending.. not f2p friendly.,,,
Please make the game more like the ads ur providing in social media. Only after money. Everything too pricey and rewards are so bad total pay to win,,,
I love to play this game all the time it's sooo fun and there's almost no adds I love to play this game all the time that why I gave it a 5 star I love that there's almost no adds and this game i sssssooo fun to play I know I said it's fun to play and almost no adds twice,,,
"Decent game to kill time. It's going to lack staying power in the long run, but it's still a fun game for the price of admission",,,
Don't waste your money on this the administration are all useless if there is -5 star I will rate this game,,,
Stupid game won't even take my money,,,
60 sec ads,,,
"No options menu at all , terrible sound, and irritating bad music .",,,
"Not at all like advertised, I got tricked into downloading this game. It's slow and clunky, definitely not worth it.. uninstall",,,
"good game just feel like the pay to win could be done without. maybe stick with just the ""spin the wheel"" aspect that apex has where every 500 spins you get some ascendant from legendary",,,
Please dont install this game....the game is boring and the customer service is not cooperative at all,,,
Why have you made the foggy maze impossible to beat? I can't even get past the first fight any more.,,,
"Be careful, this app is full of hidden fees and the chinese developers terms and condition are very abusive",,,
"Edited. F2P players have no chance at all. To get 1 of the top tier gems, you need 15,625 common gems. And you need 5 of them for 1 equipment, and there are 6 equipment in all. So to max out, you need 468,750 common gems, which will take you 25 years if you play daily and get 50 common gems a day. If you're lucky. LOL",,,
"Diamond too expensive, not relevant to topup this game",,,
"good fun game, a little slow to lv up, but it's nice to have different options of play, still need a little more to keep me active",,,
the damage jump between stages seem to multiply and no good way to boost player damage seems perfect run all depending on rng,,,
"pretty enjoyable, definitely a grindy game, and pay to advance is clearly the easiest way to play.",,,
Very fun game. Extremely P2W. If you want endgame gear then be prepared to fork out big time,,,
"When you get lvl 15 this game getting harder, without spending they diamond look like dumb to play this game, waste of time 🤣",,,
"the fact there is a timer to play the game is poor. (food) only get to play for so long before you have to wait, or pay.",,,
played the game for an hour. challenging and love the variety of weapons.,,,
pretty solid. the generated skills annoys me. needs to stop going to things I'm not going for every game.,,,
I personally like the game alot. I've been playing it for about a week and I surprisingly don't have a compliant,,,
"Really nice game, does not force advertisements while playing and the upgrade system is quite easy",,,
"Fun game, takes a while to level up but very addictive. Ads choice only",,,
seems to be a decent idle game. I suspect it will eventually become an unbearable grind... yet chill enough to start with!,,,
"Upgrading system needs to be simplified, bit overall, great game.",,,
Just a level 6 stage I need to use 6 time to make perfect the option for upgrading the guns is little,,,
"No real control of abilities. All autofire, no strategy other than which 4 to use and upgrade.",,,
"So far a nice relaxing game, kind of a tower defense but with one person(so far) and looks like a solid simple game.",,,
When I play this game it just stays on the loading screen and the start button doesn't work pls fix this bug 🐞,,,
slow startup but pretty fun. a good recommendation for anyone looking for a new game to kill time.,,,
I think the game is good but the only problem I think will come soon is the pay to win feature and I think it's gonna hurt this game as so many others,,,
It glitches out on me and I can't read what my skills do or read anything when it glitches. That is the only problem I have with it.,,,
Rifle so weak and slow. RNG really sux too. Needs better skills when lvling up per skills. Already playing a similar game better than this.,,,
"game is easy to understand and fun to play, some events to get skins and weapons and other accessories would be great.",,,
I hoped for a game like this until u have to spend money to get you ahead... it is a nice game but u gunna be stuck at levels for awhile until u get stonger ..,,,
"Overall good game, need a little bit graphics and some work the performance it's a bit laggy",,,
good game. I love the fact that you just keep leveling up. Getting stronger along with sick new and cool attacks.,,,
Addictive game. game content is interesting. please make mercenaries movements active and move there hands and bodies like the main player,,,
Game play is great tech support no so much. Made an in game purchase and never received the items bought. Try to fix it and can't get an answer and the website is hard to use,,,
the game is pretty fun up to level eight rewards are softer on this game than most others of this type put the game is fun to play on your off times,,,
"Very well made, prices for digital content could always be way lower as with any game.",,,
I think it would be beneficial if we could always gain stamina in some way so that we can continue playing the game providing we have the resources to purchase it,,,
I like it. but the energy thing is bs. it's already grindy enough as to actually need to wait for energy.,,,
Good fun for a while but seem to hit a wall after a while which makes it somewhat repeatative.,,,
"show me how to adjust the audio settings and I will give you 5 stars thanks for the automated response, but i didnt find my answer yet. 3 stars remain.",,,
needs to be more balanced. I've just started and it's showing already its pay to play. we'll win anyway,,,
"the game is good, I have 3 other games just like this one, and they all offer something unique. the main gun in this game really sets it apart from the rest!",,,
awesome game! the battles arevnever exactly the same. i just wish to have a little more options on upgrading.,,,
"update got worse. been stuck on a same stage for 3 days. not gonna keep spending money on Upgrades, just to pass 1 stage.",,,
fun to play but hars to get equipment and hard to play solo with wave enemy too fast and your equipment too low,,,
Refuses to load on firewalled phone. Calls home. Beware all apps which require network connectivity outside of the GooglePlay framework. Uninstalled.,,,
good game but the progression wall is earlier than most f2p game. meaning you need to grind or purchase earlier in the quest progression.,,,
"Pretty fun game, upgrading your character is straightforward, but yes I paid to get rid of the ads",,,
This is a game which the system will make sure that you 90% fail the game with rubbish skill combinations given so that 9 out of 10 games that you played will ensure losing rather than winning,,,
I wish there was a countdown timer so you know when missions and daily objectives will come back.,,,
"Fake game, nothing like the ads. Pretty sure it's a data theft app, I started getting spam calls an hour after I installed it. Avoid at all costs.",,,
very fun game thankfully does not bombard with ads you can choose to watch high playability and retention all round decent game will look forward to future updates,,,
"Super fun game. You have to grind, to be sure, unless you're paying to play. That being said, it's still a super fun game.",,,
good game.. fun.. no ads.. but it's hard to gain ground early on.. a lot of grinding just playing with what is given,,,
"Fun, though progression slows down a lot after the first few levels.",,,
Best tower defense ever! Buuuuuut. Hackers... Forget free to play. Hack ruin this. PS. The loot system is awesome.,,,
more options to gain weapons and weapon upgrades without spending would be nice but all in all its a fun game,,,
awesome gameplay. I think this game is a lot funnier than other similar games like... wizard doodle...or whatever. especially the co-op gameplay,,,
"TBC. so far, gameplay is simple and balanced in terms of difficulty.",,,
good game just terrible explanation on what's going on guns just have skins ?? no special effects just basic not big deal for fun just. longevity,,,
Abyss challenge for longer then 6-7 stages result in app closing followed by little to no reward or saved progress and a wasted attempt please fix this,,,
"the game is great! but when I de-gem great I lose alot of my gems, this sucks. I want them back and fix this please!",,,
"fun game to kill some time with, missions aint too long like some games this one got the mission length right",,,
"I think it's a very good game... But while I want to add my friend in the game, it's always said can't fine player? Why? It's very frustrated.",,,
"good game, fun to play. they should add weekly missions to enhance game play. instead of just having daily missions",,,
"Really fun game. Becomes a grind really quickly, and advancing is really slow.",,,
"Another game with false advertisements I downloaded this game because it says you can play as anime characters such as luffy, Naruto, and Itachi, but to no surprise this was a lie",,,
Installed on new phone and my account has disappeared. Spent a lot of time and money on this game. Will be reporting to Google.,,,
same gameplay but disappointing. i was expecting some anime characters as per ads. sad to say there isn't.,,,
fun tower defense but energy based games always force mtx to make people buy more energy or get stronger gear. been f2p and still having fun though,,,
if you battle for too long it crashes and you lose any progress I was doing abyss I was at 63 it crashed on 73 all progress lost,,,
"I really enjoy this game; however, I think the food timer should be reduced. Aside from that, it is awesome.",,,
"fun to pass some time, flirts a fine line of needing to pay to progress though.",,,
Great time killer. Just wish I can apply increased speed first go around without having to complete it first.,,,
The game is decent. I wish there was more variety of equipment and equipment skills,,,
"the game is nice , i first ever playing like these types games, I think It should be much better in future updates . thank you etc.",,,
Best in class. The Co-op option alone makes this game better than the others of its kind. Truly blew me away with this one.,,,
"connection seems to drop too easily and often. many a lost game, otherwise enjoyable",,,
"My only complaint honestly is that it requires a resource to play the game. addicting gameplay loop, very entertaining",,,
good game. But it takes so long to get stronger to win higher floors. And i mean LONG time unless u lile to donate alot.,,,
so far good 1st day playing will update review after week or 2 dropped to 3 star game is laggy and some time simple just kicks you off server says no WiFi can't even log in now sins updating game 😑,,,
Entertaining with a good reward system. Options for purchases but not required to progress,,,
"good graphics, bit confusing in menu when it comes to gear, but overall a great game so far",,,
would like a few extra ways to earn gems and special passes without having too pay essentially more goals to work towards pay to play items,,,
"I actually really enjoy this game, it's great for all the modes away from the main game and there's no silly storyline",,,
game was okay. very very hard to proceed wiyh f2p. some skills is TOTALLY USELESS. played awhile still stuck at stage 13 FOREVER.,,,
"Fun, pretty repetitive. Would be fun if selecting targets actually impacted play.",,,
Great game. A bit of a steep difficulty increase around 15 but still a lot of fun!,,,
been pretty entertaining for the time that I have played could make it a little easier to upgrade guns and unlock skins,,,
"Amazing gaming, loads of things to do and doesn't take up to much of your time. Well worth playing.",,,
The game is perma frozen on the opening screen with a day 2 claim. It won't let me go any further or even close it,,,
Your ad takes straight to play store and sometimes outright crashes what I was doing. Enjoy your 1* review,,,
great game fun to play its just that the lvl are hard which makes fun and the power ups sometimes upset me because sometimes they shoot on the most useless,,,
great game makes you think about strategy it is not simply wave to wave zombie game. I'm barely at level 15 and I can't put it down.,,,
9/10 good way to wast time... in a good way I mean ads are not over kill only giving it 9/10 do to seeing the pay to win things Basically... I'm not doing those so,,,
Great so far. Not too complex as far as game play. Upgrades are fun. Good time killer.,,,
great time killer something that I can put on the side of my desk while I'm working on something and come back every time I need to upgrade a weapon 🔫,,,
"Only just started, but seems a good concept, and decent upgrade system.",,,
Kinda wish there was more avatar design control. Along with the robot pet we have. just being able to change the color would be nice. lol Godbless,,,
I like this game so much but need more 💎 or gold coins ads to watch and can you please update this game more.than I will give you 2 more stars.,,,
"Need to be able to raise your gun level. The XP (gun parts) raising is to little,too late.",,,
"it's okay, for a limited energy game it gives you enough goes to enjoy it for a good half hour.",,,
Great game. don't like expensive random boxed. if jmpay I should be able to choose the reward.,,,
"overall pretty decent game, fun and easy to learn, no long intro or tutorial BS. definitely worth 4 outta 5 stars",,,
the best game I've played on mobile. combined tower defence and those ability upgrade hero games. excellent,,,
Have to replay the same levels too many times in order to obtain parts to level up,,,
"I've only had one tiny issue with this game, and I'm waiting for it to get resolved. But other than that this is, by far, the best game like this that I've ever played.",,,
it's a fun game! been playing a few months but intermittently at first now it's all about the grind 🤑,,,
more supplies and ways to get stronger faster at beggining of game and faster game speed by a couple of ticks or so.,,,
"great game overall, good progression, altough a little grinny at times. perfect for me, definitely recommend!",,,
"Good game, but icons on gems to easily identify them, too many sprite similarity, keep an eye on this game, if improves worth keeping",,,
"Meh, it's pretty average, no forced ads but if u don't watch ads you'll not be able to progress for a long time",,,
so far the game is good some pay to win but overall not a bad game easy gameplay and you can customize just about anything,,,
The severs are dog water! Every time I wish to watch an ad for a bonus it never loads an an it is a joke...,,,
"Has everything to be a great game, the timed energy systems kinda messes with me, but I'll give it a shot",,,
Fun game. Does seem to be very much based on you spending money so you can get ahead.,,,
honestly quite a bit of fun. it's good to see that ads only happen when you want them to.,,,
"Entertaining. People who say they can't beat a level or get far, do not understand the game mechanics. Great game.",,,
some connectivity issues but very fun. also separate servers by 100s which caused me to have to restart on another server to play with my friend,,,
it's good but I can believe am saying this but it won't let me watch an ad to get more rewards or chests it doesn't work at all,,,
"Good game. Gets a little bit repetitive, but still manages to surprise you with new additions.",,,
Ok game need fix the exploit people backing out early in multiplayer so i cant get bonus gold etc!,,,
fun but you get stuck at levels. hard to figure out how to level up,,,
simple but ranking up takes time. all the meantime your having fun. well done,,,
There is a superpower at the ad but when i open it there is no super power even one only technology waste of storage,,,
reallt enjoying would prefer to be able to speed up battles. five star game. Worth a download,,,
Needs to get rid of the reloading. It should be constant fire. More to come.,,,
"so far I'm really enjoying the game. I've noticed a few bugs, but I'm sure that there'll be updates to improve those and get rid of those",,,
Game is super fun and challenging! Love that my girlfriend and I can play together on the elite mode too.,,,
"Fun little Defense game, neat powers, fun aesthetician, recommend for a fun distraction.",,,
"different armors, weapons, and characters would be awesome. great game guys!!!!!!!",,,
"overall a good time burner, would recommend good internet to play because some some of the levels are alittle taxing if playing on a phone",,,
"Plays alot like doodle magic, but way more esthetically pleasing, which makes it way more fun in my opinion.",,,
Gameplay is fun but only for the moment. Rewards are nonexistent and gems are hard to earn,,,
"Soft brick wall which prevents you from winning — you need to pay to progress past mission 10, lame. ETA after response: there's nothing your support can help with.",,,
great and entertaining time killer. I like it when I go pewpewpew and the undead are then just dead.,,,
"super fun, very rewarding, super grindy tho. the incentives to spend money are everywhere.",,,
it's a good game I just kind of wish they had a little more availability for gun upgrades as opposed to other extra stuff,,,
this game is awesome I play it for hours sometimes it gets hard but it's still fun I hope others feel the same as me,,,
I like this game but spending over 5k diamond on Tier 2 casket Event and can't get that 2nd tier main prize is kinda not fair based on in-game cost for diamonds 😕 ...Just saying,,,
I think that this is an amazing game for both killing time at a waiting room...or chilling in bed to relax with.,,,
i keep getting ripped off on torches when i complete elite with someone..they leave before game is finished and i receive no torches..around 2000 torches im owed..fix this or game deleted,,,
"Great game so far. 1 hr in and can say not many ads and it seems like a fair system so far, will update review in future",,,
Ads events didn't work. I have 3×0.5% increase magazine capacity and from 30 hi is... still 30.,,,
"Doodle magic template is ok as it is fun, but skills need to feel diffrent, I do enjoy it but feels same game diffrent avatar",,,
it's a pretty fun idle game. My only advise increase the starting meat to like 70 or 100.,,,
"great game. very few ads, which is awesome. good customisation and plenty to do.",,,
games actually pretty fun. the only thing I'd change is the fact that I can only gain 20 levels in a game,,,
"When I installed it, my phone detected it as malware. I was wondering why that was? I think i figured out the problem.",,,
"The game you show in the advertisement is completely different from the actual game, which is complete nonsense",,,
"Just started,but seems ok. Reminds me of Dungeon Defense a bit. altho, I don't see allies yet.",,,
"After update cannot load into game, freeze at the screen with Start Game button, top left show version 1.28.100.249",,,
"great start, but becomes a bit of a slaugh after 2 weeks. slow progression without spending money",,,
"The game is decent however the DMG should be displayed differently IMO. Instead of using a long integer like 23907763, why not say 23.9M or something?",,,
-1 star for the very minimal amount of stamina. otherwise fun gameplay. rng gods for beating stages and getting good skill upgrades :/,,,
should be able to choose your level ups when you're playing the game Don't give you certain options,,,
Great game. You build your tactical skills. No two battles are the same.,,,
codes in advertising said one thing and they never work. game play is smooth. good time killer.,,,
pretty good game so far 👌 able to play the game without having ads in my face 24/7 so that's a plus as well,,,
been playing this game today really a lot of fun it wood bee nice 2 upgrade the gun its self not just mods but will update when I have played more,,,
"interesting game...but...after few weeks the account is lost,i cant find my caracter,no bind account,no nothing,i was on 1042 server and now says is full...im out.",,,
Havent played long enough but theyre asking for feedback. so far its ok. hasnt asked for micro transactions. havent seen luffy yet.,,,
"Very bad , they make it very hard for f2p , don't play unless u gonna pay tones of cash for luck and to be stuck at high lvles",,,
Best time killer while having a smoke. Thanks for making a fun game.,,,
"Great game, takes too long to kill zombies, even with that this game is really alot of fun",,,
"it's just like all the other ""defend the wall"" games. it's not bad, just the same things as all the others.",,,
Once you hit the pay wall it's expensive af and the drop rates are ridiculous like you have to pay hundreds of euros just for 1 item,,,
"Major major pay to win game, unless you buy into their expensive contests, you will advance very very slowly",,,
"Great game... play at your own pace, not p2w...support is more helpful here than in most games. Please give this a try... you will not be disappointed.",,,
o I think the game is really good the graphics are very great and I think people should buy this game because it's really fun.,,,
"fun game, hopefully will be able to enhance gun in different ways later in game. lots of potential",,,
Game is very enticing and strategic only thing I have a problem with is adding friends it's confusing,,,
"cool game, pretty the same as the publicity, not everything but near it, wouldnt put money into it.",,,
Great game but girlfriend in server 735 and I can't find her to add. her. I'm on server 2 something. how do I add her as a friend,,,
"Using fake ads to make them download the game. Stealing peoples video's on YouTube for ad revenue is bad, you should be ashamed!",,,
"interesting and fun to play, tough tho and might probably p2w game, but myself ain't competitive, so just good enuf for a casual game",,,
The amount of fake advertisements they put out is criminal 🤢. Game itself is okay but don't go into this game assuming u will get those anime character skins and skills. None of those exist.,,,
pretty fun game slow to start then once get higher in level you really start to feel the damage you do,,,
"Stuck on ""Start Game"", and goes no further. Big fail! Immediately uninstalled.",,,
I am loving the game. just wish I could upgrade quicker without having to spend money,,,
Really cool game. I like the upgrade system and how it's a fire and forget type of game.,,,
Lost my main account.. can't find it anymore need help,,,
Just started it's fun for now. I love the many combos and options for your in game skills,,,
pay to win game doesn't give currency and it's need way to much for everything and a lot of it even paying money doesn't give you enough,,,
"typical build a base game personal i prefer just dealing with the comat side ,not really all that into the base buliding side of things",,,
just started but so far so good. love the mechanics and aesthetic of the game.,,,
its a little slow on the upgrades but its fun recomend for use in cars and lunch breaks,,,
Where is zoronand Luffy in your advertising video.I don't see it ingame.,,,
It's OK. Don't like time gates on games. Skill rng is not great in the missions.,,,
although the 7-day welcome event was fun it was level capped and if you are a free to play player the final reward is unobtainable,,,
Level 26 and had to stop playing due to the new updates I can't get in now it's a awesome game tho,,,
Artifacts not getting equiped,,,
a fun game so far it doesn't seem to be a pay to win so that is nice you can pay to get a foot up but it's fine.,,,
simple addictive fun. don't have to spend money to progress either.,,,
"fantastic game to play, highly recommend it. Time fly's by when playing. just love the game...",,,
Amazing Defense game with a great concept of updating and as ons while linking players together. Well Done.,,,
Game wont even load now cant get past the claim for the patrol just freezes and should be easier to get better equipment,,,
if u play this game u need money not skill,,,
definitely better than the .io games!! adds do not pop up every 2 minutes!,,,
it's a good game just needs easier leveling and more coins for repeat stages,,,
so far so good. the gear mechanic seems tedious and complicated.,,,
"Slow like shyt... shooting is slow, cool down is slow....",,,
"everything seem good to me except need to wait for 10 mins just to get 1 energy point, that's too long to me.. hopefully time will be shortened",,,
"It's not fun at all, i downloaded because of the ad and it was something different,",,,
"Dropped to one star until they do something to help the FTP. Gacha rates are truly awful. No pity system. Dropping $100 can get you absolutely nothing. Extremely, extremely P2W.",,,
love the game. at least no nome stop add. keeps me on clicking on it when really I want to.,,,
its fine but becomes a repetitive grind if you don't spend money to advance faster.,,,
"Been playing for 3 weeks.,still a peashooter Now after 5 weeks I erased this game .the power ups is rubbish Can I give zero stars?",,,
I feel the game needs a way to better up grade faster and a way to get better gear and equipment.,,,
Servers are having frequent crashes since maintenance on 4/7/2024. Ruined my gaming experience.,,,
"good game, only thing is the level ups cap at 20 inside the battle, this should be extended",,,
difficulty ramps up way too quickly especially since there is an energy limit,,,
"pretty cool game, a little hard in the beginning but got a hang of it better when I got stronger.",,,
"Pretty low key and fun, tends to get a bit grindy but I haven't gotten tired of it yet.",,,
The RNG is busted and it expects you to spend money or be on the same level for weeks. Skip this one if you have to work/kids and can't sink 500 hrs into a mobile game where it's rigged against you unless you pay up.,,,
One star away for UI hiccups and obvioud levels that work as big timegates.,,,
Nice but as usual... Some stages couldn't clear in perfect mode.. Either grind or paid,,,
Great game so far just wish there were better packs to purchase with builds and skins in them.,,,
"ok game, gaining xp is pretty slow and getting upgrades is slow too but so far a good time passer",,,
Pay to win game. You can't progress past level 15 if you don't spend money. Waste of time.,,,
"great game , could do with a few upgrades and movement for your character.",,,
game needs to be fun. guess you guys think otherwise. it's so slow that I Uninstalled it faster.,,,
could use a different gun system with instead of skins adds different types of weapons like RPGs pistols smgs lmgs and such and light turret upgrades for the walls,,,
I really enjoy it but it's a bit to difficult to get gold to upgrade skills.,,,
Good game. Growth is on the slower side. Slow progression.,,,
I love it wish I knew a better way to talk to players specifically about levels and how to pass certain bosses like 35,,,
seems fun visuals are a tad boring but it's addictive for a reason I can't figure out,,,
"Game is fun, but progress slows down after stage 10 a little to much.",,,
"its a great game, only reason I didn't give it five stars is because you can't move freely around but other then that it's great",,,
The 0.5% ammo capacity upgrade is laughable; easily one of the most useless upgrades I have seen.,,,
I wish I had my old account I spent a lot of time and some money on it and now I'm starting a new 1 for no reason but over all it's a fun game.,,,
Aerial bomb could use some work to not attack a target right after it has already died.,,,
fun game. Just takes a long time before you can access other features.,,,
"Great game, level up process is slower than I expected. won't stop me playing though.",,,
Fun time killer with a variety of ways to upgrade and change how you fight.,,,
"seems good so far, a bit more stamina would be nice, but all in all not major!",,,
"The game itself is fine, but the energy doesn't recharge nearly fast enough for me.",,,
over all a really good gane just need to make it a little more rewarding for free to play players,,,
A little slow getting through the level but good way to spend time out,,,
seems good so far needs more content and unique skills and ult's.,,,
Very fun game however the connection issues and the fluidity of the UI is holding me back,,,
Fun game. No ads unless you want to watch them for extra bonuses.,,,
"I love the game, the only issue is the inconsistency of certain events and prizes.",,,
Good fun. only adverts if you choose to as well which is a bonus.,,,
"Great game, although would recommend a slider to buy multiple things from shops at once",,,
I just hate there's only 1 retool and having to learn several abilities I haven't invested in.,,,
"solid game,a little slow on the early upgrades unless you puchase.",,,
"pretty good game, can be slow to progress and coins are hard to come by",,,
love it. they actually have challenges. I also love the background music. feels like I'm about to watch a 90s Jean Claud vandam movie. best of 2024,,,
"It's been interesting as your choice determines the outcome, which has been fun",,,
There's way much better games then this that are actually balanced and offer way better package deals to buy,,,
"Awesome survival game. Recommend implementing a ""Remove All"" option to the Gem section of Equipment.",,,
fun game but levels feel a little to long sometimes... I have still enjoyed the game though,,,
No in your face ads is an immediate win when it comes free games I'll give my time to.,,,
"great game, only watch ads if u want 👌 pay to win, but the grind isn't that bad. graFix is good",,,
"we need tutorials. I started the w/o knowing anything. still, a very cool game.",,,

"very fun game. about just as good as doodle magic, maybe a little better.",,,
pretty decent game. the babe scrolling across the top announcing lucky winners is annoying,,,
fun game. minimal ads. difficulty curve is horrible tho.,,,
Game opens and that's that. You cannot play it. It just stays in the main menu.,,,
"nice upgrades, decent game so far. maybe a fire rate upgrade of some sort?",,,
Fun game so far. Don't need to p2w if you don't want too. I do wish it was updated more frequently tho.,,,
good so far will give more stars once I unlock everything and get to see more progress in the game!,,,
"4/5, only issue I'm having is where ALL the text disappears from the screen.",,,
it's great but the one thing that bugs me is the fact you can't aim when the shooting starts,,,
"easy to play, has good replayable value, can't wait to unlock new stuff",,,
"Fun game to play or kill time, I love that it's not solely strategy based, but a test of luck",,,
"simple easy to play time burner with progressive armor and weapons, can advance with money's",,,
not so nice to play.lack of free gift. Lack of power. need money to upgrade.,,,
"A bit grindy but once you play around with gems, it gets a bit easier.",,,
decent so far. power levels of different skills early seem skewed.,,,
Familiar concept but lovely design and smooth animations. Decent game,,,
it is a really good game for people who like to think a lot but I think they should add some more chat options.,,,
little more description on how to upgrade the main weapon would be helpful.,,,
its alright its very grind heavy but at least its somewhat accurate to whats presented in the ads,,,
A pretty fun way to kill time. Upgrading special abilities is fun.,,,
"Unplayable, add won't go away to do anything... Already tried to re download....",,,
"all right game, I really would like a way to turn off seeing what other people get from the gacha, I truly do not care what other people are getting",,,
so far so good. getting upgrades in the beginning would be helpful,,,
a very good game. recommend to play if want to kill time on something while waiting . nice game. good job,,,
pretty fun game. seems like a lot of p2w aspects though... just started so not entirely sure,,,
needs to be a little easier to clear lvls and have more ways to earn stuff to lvl up,,,
"pretty fun game. Not pay to win at all, but so far it's the same old same old. Fun regardless",,,
Finally a challenging upgrade game based on wave gameplay and upgradable weaponry!,,,
"Pretty good. Haven't had to spend money yet, but will someday to support the devs.",,,
decent for what it is. if you lime simple it is it. dosent lie from adverts.,,,
no energy cost to play it's not worth it do to time consumption of level completion,,,
Actually a decent little game levels may be a tad repetitive but still good,,,
Its alot of fun. didn't understand how mechanics worked at first but git the hang of it,,,
"Was a great game, but now everytime I log in there's a error and nothing works :/",,,
it's soo fun but when multiplayer disconnected it gets annoying at times but fun otherwise,,,
seems a bit stiff on power up co trols maybe more non video re rolls and or more sta regen,,,
pretty fun game just wish when choosing your skill upgrade you had more choices than just 3,,,
"Decent, it's a grind game that's kinda slow but worth it, very little adds",,,
excellent game. I've been looking for this after seeing adds on Instagram.,,,

Great game.. Fun n strategy grinding for upgrade.. Played for 2 week already but still fun 4 me,,,
Game was great but after installing a new update there was walware detected and I was forced to uninstall,,,
weapons are a little slow to update. otherwise a calmly paced game not too bad,,,

fun and interesting. keeps my attentions but what am I other than a goldfish,,,

need more ways to gain stamina but the game is great and simple.,,,
"Nice alternative to the ordinary TD or Rogue style, lots of options for mods!",,,
highly addictive and fun. enjoy mixing up the combos and playing with a friend,,,
This is a good game to spend time when you don't have nothing to do and if you don't want to play alone can invite ppl along the fun,,,
Is there a way to turn off the notification in the top middle of the screen? I don't want to see what everyone got when they open a chest,,,
I like all the different way to level up your character and love the game play,,,
wish we could see which serve the players are on if we look at the rankings.,,,
fun game but wish you could press the screen to focus a specific area of attack,,,
Too much grinding needed post initial game. No intrusive ads.,,,
"poor graphics, lack of game modes, need to pay for weapons, many cash grabbing perks",,,
fun game to just be afk. the Game will definitely not give you anything good unless you pay for it though,,,
"It's a good time filler game but I'll love to get a ""energy"" refill on level up",,,
Very great and addicting game. Missions/Challengers are very hard though,,,
Armor for perfect quality hard to get.farm and farm make me bored.30 times run elite i still cant get perfect quality.yaksss that bored ok,,,

"This game is click bait for people that can't understand math.Before spending money on this game pleaseSTOP🛑,have a think,check out every function.Whatever you want to buy is probably cheaper in a different shop.Regardless if you're rich in real life,do not sponsor💩like this.If you do then YOU👈 ARE THE PROBLEM.Do not sponsor thieves(that think they are clever)Give some change to homeless instead.If you don't believe me just look at monthly 💎/privl. packs and compare them. No ℹ️on what you 💰",,,
"a bit more interaction with battles, but a nice time killer.",,,
Good time consumer fun and addictive could do with some more game modes however,,,
can be made offline to complete common stages atleast. negative 1🌟 for not being offline game.,,,

Team up with players or play solo this game is great and treats their community well I'd pay money if I could,,,

All is good...but 15 exp? Come on!!!!! So little it so hard to level up and you give us 15 exp only?,,,
"Worst game I ever played, the adds 👌🏻 Ithink he created a game just to promote other brands.",,,
Game is fun and addictive. I love the leveling on your skills and weapons. Lots of fun.,,,
App steals content from creators for their ads. It's completely misleading. Do not download!!!,,,
good game but it needs to be easier to get weapons to level up.,,,
a bit lagg when starting but overall a good game.maybe add more choices for top up items,,,

Great game. Easy to play and figure out. Fun and relaxing.,,,
there is similar games... just with different character and monster... you get bored easily,,,
"fun game, fun mechanics that combines tower defense and survivor like mechanics.",,,
"Only top up can increase your power, not friendly to free to play player",,,

load screen always freezes and have to use stylus to get through it,,,
needs an option when picking upgrade while playing to watch a video to get all three,,,

"Level progress is somewhat slow, but its a fun grind overall",,,
pretty good game. just a basic tower defense type game.,,,
"it sometimes has connection issues, but over all it's a great game",,,
"shocking how free to play, and how the adds are low and not required.",,,
fun and simple room for improvement as far as item accessibility,,,
Nothing great. Average zombie wave game. Misleading video.,,,
One of the best games of this type I've played in a while. No forceful ads.,,,
OK could be better but the words be missing letters so you don't know what you pressing at time,,,
I love this game just started a little while ago but it's a great twist on tower defense games,,,
Only issue is that it needs to have the option of changing your gun without purchases.,,,
would love to see an endless mode so you can really work up skills,,,
Its loading but cant pass the first page . I click on claim and nothing works,,,
Pretty fun! have gotten about 8 hours out of it and only spent $1,,,
I like the game just wish the energy recharged faster or was no need for it,,,
"very interesting gameplay..slow progress but still,very fun...",,,
awesome graphics and characters and great fun and really enjoyable,,,
nice game. love the concept and graphic. suitable for low end phone like me,,,
game is very fun addicting haven't put it down in 3 days every chance I get when I'm not working I play,,,
fun but should make some skins and other stuff available without having to pay,,,
3 stars only because it's really glitchy. But is really fun.,,,
Barely playable since stage 10. Paywall is really thick.,,,
"very entertaining. strategic game play but ofcourse, it is a pay to win",,,
classic graphics tower defense. Brings back that old school feel.,,,
not bad could use some work here and there but it does great when it comes wasting my time,,,
"pushes ads and spending too much, but overall fun.",,,
extremely addictive in it's simplicity and I can't wait for more.,,,
last star lost as dame unplayable offline. add the offline mode and you will win the last star,,,
"pay to play, slow character progression, weapon skills and abilities",,,
it's a fun and enjoyable game for when you want to fight the horde.,,,
great game but damage is to low and forced to pay to get stronger not good it not really balanced game,,,
"I think it needs to be smoother but other than that, beautiful game",,,
Was fun but the game has glitches and freezes when I open it,,,
"Fun game, easy start with a slow pace and not too overwhelming",,,
would be nice to see you previous augments on the pause screen.,,,
"Yeah, I watched the game because it was so cool and I went 2 that we will seeight, but you.We were damming too appre.Shake cool at the plane.Gatplaying big game wine.Now it week be so cool",,,
"none of the adverts play, so impossible to earn rewards or to formally quests to each 3 adverts",,,
Good game could use a little improvement but other than that fun to play.,,,
"It keeps saying version check failed, can't connect to version server",,,
I can't add any more stars because I don't have any control of my gun and can only sit and watch like a dumb teddy bear,,,
cannot purchase stamina = time blocked and reduced playing time even with purchases,,,
pretty fun no ads inbetween matches so can play as long as you have stamina,,,
good just wish it happen a little better shop selection but overall a good time killer,,,
"pretty fun game, addictive, but slow to progress your guy.",,,
it's fun pick up put down game that ramps difficulty quite quickly,,,
overall a good game however progression is decently slow (this is without paying),,,
kinda slow in the beginning but game play and graphics are nice,,,
unless spend money hard to progress in the game part level 4.,,,
"Similar to doodle magic, but better balanced and without the forced ads.",,,
would be better if we got like new player challenges that helped us upgrade better,,,
Hard to advance through the level and it is pay to win game. 👎👎👎,,,
love the game. keeps me very occupied. hope it only gets better from her. great work,,,
"Slow start, but it's fun to play and good way to pass time.",,,
"good overall, could do with extra character adaptions/changes",,,
"Just started, have only beat 3 levels, but so far it's fun",,,
"Fun game, the most polished and balanced out of all the similar games I've tried",,,
very exciting and challenging game really enjoying it wish I had more diamonds lol..,,,
"Honestly, I've been on the fence about playing it, but it's been pretty enjoyable so far.",,,
Absolutely legendary! Easy to learn and super fun to play,,,
"casual playing, nice to play. but can u do in offline mod too",,,
"it's kinda hard to advance . but, still playable.",,,
Actually pretty fun for a mobile game. Has managed to keep my playing for awhile,,,
"Installed, can't launch even after 10s, uninstalled the garbage.",,,
"not bad, athough I wished they added more from advatisments into the game like uzimaki kid",,,
"great game, haven't paid for anything and still dropping zombies🤙",,,
decent game but very hard to get powerful without paying.,,,
Good Game to play just what I need to pass the time after all the shores around the house,,,
"Not bad so far, been enjoying the gift codes and gameplay.",,,
"actually a fun game, no extremely long wait times to keep playing either",,,
Good game but you will need to spend money to level up!,,,
good game. nice and smooth graphic. overall okay,,,
"Great Game, lot of fun. Just takes a bit to get going.",,,
"pretty good, no annoying ads .. smetimes clunky but still good... i enjoy it",,,
"great way to spend time, works well with the elite battle assistance",,,
really fun and creative. needs faster reload.,,,
"it's hard to progress because RNG, not because of skill.",,,
gift code only give 1 blue key. isnt worth it ill give 5 stars when my char progress is good,,,
fun game short ads for better options and upgrades.... I'm addicted,,,
"Same game as the ads, so far i dont need to pay to win",,,
the advertisement for free gift is always broken and not functioning 😥,,,
could add more waves to lower map elite modes other wise pretty good,,,
so far so good less advertisment and upgrade without paying and I'm enjoying this game 🎯,,,
Fun great game to kill time with challenging levels 👏,,,
"if you like mobile games this is the one, a pure blast if you like shooter's.",,,
pretty okay so far still in early game takes bit of time to do some progress,,,
"boring as hell, whats the gameplay on this ?. Worst than any idle game out there",,,
fun game strategy in a progressive fashion and different.....,,,
good game but as a f2p player...I feel like I hit a deadend after 10 levels,,,
I think it is mid the games good but the wait time to get the app is to much,,,
Not fun. Hit stage 4 and now will take weeks to progress. Uninstalling now,,,
this game is steadfast at progression but overall it's worth every grinding minute 8/10,,,
Nice low attention game to play just to pass the time.,,,
"everything is about luck. if luck is on ur side, u can pass smoothly on each stages",,,
"good game, gets hard to beat without buying stuff fast.",,,
good time waster. im sure the paywall hits quick though.,,,
good gameplay but very little in the way of telling the player how to play,,,
the announcement is annoying. It's better to move it at the very top.,,,
Fun and easy game to take a few minutes off your busy schedule.,,,
Only been playing for a sort while but actually alot of fun.,,,
fun game just don't like the energy to fight makes progress slower,,,
"so far... interesting gsme, but i noticed it will require alot of grinding but fun to play",,,
I really like this game its fun very simple and addicting as hell!,,,
Blatant ripoff of survivor.io with all of the crashes and none of the creativity.,,,
"Great game, but still a few bugs that hinder gameplay",,,
Great game. It takes longer than expected to become stronger but the game is great.,,,
fun and satisfying! Just wish I could play often!,,,
It's so fun it's not like a game you can play if you don't have anything to do it actually fun in general,,,
"Pretty much pay to win the model, you need to focus more on the events where fair to play players can earn some rewards",,,
It's ok bit not what is advertised which is a trend that needs to stop,,,
would be better if ads were limited to gaining better equipment.,,,
Ever since I did the update it won't load . It stays on the main page,,,
pay to win type of game but good game if you want to take it really slow,,,
"a little laggy sometimes, but a decent static survivor game",,,
fun game. please allow players to control where to shoot rather than tapping,,,
this is an amazing game with very few ads. highly recommend,,,
"just a bystander, other than selecting power up I really don't do anything on every board",,,
enjoyable enough game for time wasting during lunch break.,,,
Game hasn't reset in 3 days. Progression is super slow.,,,
"Fun to play but slow progress unless ""pay to win""",,,
fun but slow progress and not many events to spice it up,,,
fun to play but no learning help. but like I said fun to play.,,,
Saw an ad where they beat a level. Was convinced.,,,
Stamina is annoying Devs are awesome they immediately respond and really want to make the game fun,,,
Fun game but need little balance work around progression.,,,
nice game but hard to progress without paying money.,,,
not a bad game but the prices and the need for purchases ruins it for me,,,
super slow to get any progression and your gonna have to pay money or quit,,,
pretty good but wish you could have more guns at a time than just one,,,
It's a good game app but needs different weapons to pick.,,,
love it. slow at first but builds as you go along.,,,
fun pick up and play with solid battle and cool skills,,,
nice game.. simple. nice easygoimg games but some stave. need thinking,,,
fun game to play and pass the time and challenging as well,,,
"would be nice to know where to get gun upgrades from, but a fun game nevertheless",,,
This game is fun but getting armour is quite time consuming,,,
"Honestly, would rather bang the survivors than playing this game for 15 minutes",,,
"Extremely fun. Easy gameplay. Fun, fun, fun",,,
difficulty spikes around 7th floor. not enough gems.,,,
wish there were different characters to use from start with various perks,,,
"Fun game, but progress slows very early on.",,,

music is great. game play is satisfying. 10/10,,,
great time sink easy to play and understand game mechanics,,,
it's OK. but adverts do not play so cannot get rewards...,,,
fun game. learn what tactics work best against different enemies,,,
decent. the difficult curve hits quick if you're f2p.,,,
monsters with shields are too much to handle . shield monsters to be nerf.,,,
actually really fun and the adverts are true to what the game is,,,
very fun idle defence game. graphics are really nice.,,,
"great game, no forced ads, good pace of progression",,,
good game except nothing to buy in the shop for the diamonds you earn.,,,
"Funky little game and makes a change, no ads",,,
Fun for a mobile game but Upgrades are slow.,,,

This is a fun game. I have put a few hours in the game and still want to play.,,,
"just like the ads say, fun and easy",,,
takes forever to build up unless you wanna pay to get better stuff,,,
Very fun and challenging. hardly any ads,,,
"love this game, great way to pass time and make it enjoyable 😉",,,
the only reason it's a 3 star is the skill rng is bad and you can't lock out skills,,,

"хорошая игра 1) хотелось бы управлять оружием больше. 2) наносишь автоматом несколько попаданий и в того же зомби автоматически бьёт молния, хотя он и так уже убит почти, нолучается расходуется молния практически в пустую",,,
